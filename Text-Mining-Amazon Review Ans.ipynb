I had read a lot of websites extolling how good of a price it was based on the features and decided to give it a chance.Overall, I would say that it is worth the money, but, having it for a few days now, there are some obvious pros and cons.Pros:Definitely the price3 years of software support/upgradesNot full of bloatwareCons:The camera takes great pictures, but the software is lacking so every time that you take a picture and want to see it, you need to wait 5 seconds before the phone processes it.There is no wireless charging.There is no facial recognition.The sound was a real letdown. It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones.The screen is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn't seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones.I definitely think it's in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying. But, keep these cons in mind and add in that soon Google will be releasing the 5g versions which this one is not.\",\n",

       " '  Little details...  At 479 this phone through Amazon was half the price that some wireless providers wanted... which was 800. Then of course I\\'d be stuck paying tax on monthly payments for two years as the thing remained locked with that provider. So I saved 320 on this purchase. It arrived unlocked as described, new and ready to use in Canada. I\\'m five feet and  six smurfs so it\\'s smaller size is perfect. The battery lasted as long as a new Pixel 4a should. My Pixel1 had 32 Gigs of space this phone has 128 which is tons. The charge cord has the same newer type \"C\" end as the other Pixel phones on both ends of it, detachable from the charging block which made transferring things like my Apps, music data and call list easy. The system responds fast and the keyboard isn\\'t querky like my Pixel1. For a person not so advanced in tech this phone is straight forward and easy to use. It came with a guided set up built into it that only took five minutes to complete. Just five years ago it would\\'ve taken a half hour. The phone has an anti-slip coating on the back. So if you\\'re the type  that doesn\\'t place it in a wallet or case that little detail will help this phone from slipping out of your hand and crashing to the floor.  ...I use a wallet because I have a poor memory so my phone and cards are in one place. I played a shooting game to test it\\'s speed last night...the phone was more responsive than I was. Lol.  ...So I know this phone wasn\\'t refurbished. All said...it was a tremendous purchase. I got exactly the phone upgrade I wanted, new and nearly half the cost through a seller on Amazon to last the next few years. Thanks!',\n",
       " '  El mejor teléfono en calidad precio del momento',\n",
       " \"  This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a.  After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released, I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a.One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price. I didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network. This phone was a bargain at $349, but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price.The Good: Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up. The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue. The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly. The Pixel 4a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7. It used a USB cable to connect and download everything. Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost. Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.  Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues, but nothing that couldn't be fixed.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate. It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes.  It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down. The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used.  Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features. This battery lasts all day long even with regular use.  The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome!  It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour.The Bad: The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context. There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features. Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water. Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.  It really isn't a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway.This phone does take a USC-C cable so it isn't compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices, which use Micro USB cables.  It comes with one USB-C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car.  Again, not a huge deal because of the battery life.Summary: This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users. It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones. It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life. Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars.\",\n",
       " '  I purchased this phone as replacement for my old phone (Xperia XA1, released in 2017, ~C$330), and used about 1 month.Display : Large, bright and beautiful. Though Xperia XA1 sometimes had touch issue (no response) around the display edge, this Pixel 4a does not have any touch issue so far.CPU : Fast and quick response. I have no stress during my use. I mainly use web browser, mail, maps, SNS apps, YouTube and so on (light apps only). I don\\'t play heavy apps like game on this smartphone. So I can\\'t say whether this phone is good for playing game or not. When I used Xperia XA1, displaying photo took several seconds. However, this Pixel 4a can show everything quickly.Storage : 128GB is large enough for me, difficult to use up all.Camera : Can take beautiful pictures. Video is also very good. \"Astrophotography mode\" can take photos of night skies. I used this function in Vancouver, BC, Canada (look at the photo I posted). ... Not bad for a smartphone camera. But I felt it is difficult to take a beautiful photo of the milky way as found on google image search. Maybe because light pollution in Vancouver is terrible.Battery life : Battery lasts long enough.Fingerprint reader : The sensitivity of the reader is good. The reader is placed on the rear of the phone. I don\\'t think this position is good. I sometimes mistakenly touched the sensor when I picked up my phone.Appearance : Mat black body looks nice.

El audio es bueno pero me hubiera gustado un poco más de volumen.Una sola cámara que hace fotos super nitidas con buenos colores y HDR de impacto que en cualquier condición es sorprendente. No encontrarás mejor cámara que esta ni siquiera en gamas altas; acompañada del mejor video en android actualmente.Experiencia android limpia, buenísima y fluida a más no poder, con android 11 y posiblemente se actualizará hasta la versión de android 14.En la batería me ha dado como máximo 6 horas y 30  minutos de pantalla activa, y lo menos que me ha dado siendo más exigente son 4 horas y 50 minutos (3,140 mAh).

El sonido estereo no será el mejor, pero el simple hecho de ser estereo ya le da un cambio de 360 grados a la experiencia con el audio, nada mal.  Recomiendo comprar un case, ya que por el material y diseño del teléfono se llega a resbalar si no tienes cuidado.',\n",
       " \"  Don't get me wrong - Samsung makes fine products but I was really tired of the duplication and silly Bixby stuff. Sure you can try and turn off Bixby (because it's useless) but once in a while you either hit the wrong button or a Samsung update causes you to re-activate it.Couple this with the Samsung browser no thanks have Chrome, Samsung contacts - no thanks have Google contacts, Samsung gallery, no thanks have Google photos.BUT the most annoying feature was the inability to easily turn ring volume up separately from media volume. On the Pixel just hit the volume up or down and a menu appears, hit the little slider icon and you can change volume for all types of things.The phone is fast, light and the camera is fantastic - the built in spirit level to the camera interface is great - makes you get perfectly level photos all the time.\",\n",

The fingerprint wouldn't work and I could not access the GooglePlayStore for more apps.After a chat with Google the chat person said to factory reset it. I did this reluctantly even after she told me all my data would be saved. IT WASNT so I lost it all and it didn't solve the print or playstore problems. Next day after 3 hours of more chat and futile tests with Google they agreed to send me a replacement if I send this one back. So I have and I hope the new one (may be refurbished..ugh!) will perform better. Overall it's a good device and the photos are excellent. Doesn't integrate well with my Apple Mac and iPod tho. But for its general ability its a good device. Don't know about how it is an actual phone.\",\n",

       " \"  I was very excited about this phone. I read multiple glowing reviews. Phone arrived yesterday and I've spent several hours with it. I am coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy S8. There's nothing really wrong with that phone. It's just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone. The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active (bad for road trips).Here are some thoughts/findings about the 4a vs the S8:1. On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S82. The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode. I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a3. The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove. Gboard on S8 does not have this4. I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again5. I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a, but it still feels like I could easily drop it6. The battery life isn't that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I'd say7. Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect8. 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice (vs 64 GB on the S8), but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S89. 4a gets hot! It has complained about not being able to do a few things (transcribe for example) because it was too hotJury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not. And if it does replace it, what happens to the old phone? It's only worth $100 or less.I'd say if you were looking for a great phone for the money, and it's better that what you currently have, definitely get the 4a as it's a good price and has a lot of great features. However, carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better.\",\n",
       " \"  Though I've only had this Pixel 4a a few days, it has been great so far.  The phone came roughly 60% charged and, as far as I can see, didn't require any security updates right away. I was able to open the box and start set-up right away without waiting for charging. The instructions for set-up were good.  The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less. It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out.  This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief.  The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn’t take a ton of time; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password, and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone.  Also some settings needed to be readjusted.  As of now, I don't seem to have lost anything, though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names. To clarify: the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text. I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn't being supported anymore and performance was getting slower.  I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don't have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands. I don't use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me. I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us. I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly. Another good factor is the price of the 4a (this was significant in our decision), particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don't need or want. An additional plus is the larger screen (no bezel) while still keeping the small size of the phone. The screen looks classy and it's small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse.  Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel. The plastic hardware isn't a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet-case for my phones so protection is provided & people don't see the outside of the phone anyway. There are a few nice, new 'bells and whistles' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far. I'm still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double-tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out.  I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting.  I’m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot (supposedly one is for editing) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos, so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time. I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon.  I’m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a.  Overall, the upgrade from the flagship Pixel (or Pixel One, or whatever they call it now) appears to have been a good move.\",\n",
       " \"  It has been a long wait, as my old Pixel continued to deteriorate, but glad that I was able to upgrade to now my favorite Android phone. The Pixel 4a is amazing, the colors are a little bit different than my old Pixel, but I know I had the same situation when I was moving from my Nexus 5x. This phone is beautiful and with multiple applications open, it's fast and smooth. I'm using the eSim with T-Mobile and that works great. I have spent a couple hours using it and really no complains, it's light, but not flimsy and my Spigen Hybrid case doesn't add much to it.\",\n",
       " '  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\\n\\n\\n  \\xa0Just got the pixel 4a on Friday release day when all the Amazon units started arriving, 3 days ago and loved it. Battery life seemed great and the phone was snappy. But after the 2nd day I noticed the 4a would not stop rebooting and I could not figure it out as I was not running any new apps. After scratching my head and playing around with it, it seems to be a physical build quality issue where the battery power source is interrupted. See the video of me tapping the phone on my desk and it just turning off, repeatable every time. After I filmed this video the phone would not turn back on. I posted this issue to Reddit and someone else confirmed they had the exact same issue. There must be some major quality control issue.',\n",
       " \"  No user manual, not in the box, not online.  It seems the only available information is on Google's Pixel Phone Help web page and on the phone itself.  Both assume I know enough about what I don't know to search for it.  According to one post, the rationale for limiting user information to online help is the rapid pace of change.  That's what versioning is for:  new release, new version of the manual.  It's no more difficult than updating online help.  Both formats are useful; each serves a different purpose.I may be wrong, but I suspect the company's refusal to produce a user manual is evidence of the disdain with which Google engineers view their user community.  The attitude is not uncommon among software developers.  I know whereof I speak; I am a software developer, though not for Google.And, yes, I returned the phone.\",\n",
       " '  The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid-range phone I bought three years ago would break.  The new offerings have not been compelling, mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes (e.g. 7nm).  That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid-range phones.  I bought the Pixel 4a because it was:  (1) One of the least expensive; (2) Offers one of the best OS upgrade/update policies; and (3) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm--pick your reason not to like China right now--there are at least four.  There are things I wish it had, primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor, but the 730 is plenty fast. IMHO, we\\'re well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors (gamers excluded) I\\'ll upgrade my wife\\'s phone to 5G later, we would mainly need that for tethering, and we don\\'t both need it.  It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51.The packaging is fairly basic, containing the phone, a 120 volt charging block, USB-C cable and a sim tool.  Also, it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB-C.  That is given to help connect to your old phone, but is also useful for Yubi security keys.  The phone came roughly 60% charged and didn\\'t require any security updates that I noticed, having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days (which makes me think I missed a security update being installed).As to the phone, it\\'s roughly the same size as what I\\'m used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus, but it is slightly narrower.  Overall I like the change.  I have not noticed any lag, and overall the phone seems very responsive, as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design. I wasn\\'t sure I\\'d like the fingerprint scanner on the back, but that has been fine. Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all, or maybe I\\'m just not patient enough.  My old phone said \"preparing\" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone.Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick, with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly.  The only problem I\\'ve had is related to my Google Suite Account, which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account.  That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account, which I\\'m still trying to work around.  If you don\\'t have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn\\'t be an issue.  I also had to change a few of the default settings, but surprisingly few.  I turned off a few things to save battery life, such as monitoring for songs in the background, and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, which I prefer to their gestures system.Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal.  I\\'ll report back if it can\\'t get through a normal day with at least 25% of battery left.',\n",

Everything has some ad you cannot get rid of (I\\'m looking at your Print store ad in G Photos here!) Terrible photo/file management. Very poor notification management. When I open my phone, I want to see MY stuff, not YOUR garbage! The app icon management leaves MUCH to be desired. Messaging? What a crowded bunch of \"enhanced\" options. That not enhanced, it is just useless clutter. Oh look, yet another notification for Call blocking while I write this! Yep, third one today and have the notifications turned off. Not from apps I have installed but from Android itself. Glad this has a long return option as I will continue to test it out but so far...the 3 year old phone from a much-maligned company has you BEAT! (and it was $100+ cheaper!)',\n",

       " \"  An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions. And with the global economic challanges ahead, the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment.The form factor is ideal for me. Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens, the tradeoffs are too big IMO. The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light!The pure Android is a plus. I have had bloatware on my previous two devices (Huawei) so it is a welcome change. The option to 'pause' apps is great too.Battery is good. Easily a full day. I now have battery saver mode set to auto-enable at 75% and can get 1.5 days of moderate usage.I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization. The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more.As an aside, the P30 was a form favourite of mine, the best smartphone I had owned. Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor. It edges the 4a on performance (the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader. But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30, albeit only slightly.Anyway, I am sold on the 4a. It delivers in spades. I don't need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water. I don't need a 90+hz display (the 4a's OLED display is excellent BTW) nor do I need facial recognition. I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life.I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection.\",\n",
       " '  Pros:- Clean android layer experience.- A main camera but achieves its goal.- Decent storage : 128 GB, no SD memory slot.- 6GB RAM, for many open applications or other activities.- If you like small phones this is an ideal size.- Good display OLED.- Jack 3.5 mmConst:- Plastic body.- The speakers are stereo, but when listening too loud there is some distortion.- Snapdragon SDM730 instead of an SDM765, the processor is good but if you compare this phone with other mid-range phones, you have a difference.',\n",
       " \"  I just received this pixel 4a and have already experienced video call issues in terms of the quality, on whatsapp and duo. My callers get terribly pixelated videos of me that are so bad that they can't even see my face anymore. And other times it gets so blurry and visually noisy especially in low light settings, with a pixelated areas. I know it is not my internet speed because I've never experienced this before with my last pixel xl phone. I noticed this issue before the Android 11 update but it still continued afterwards. Nothing changes even after I restart. The phone is not even a day old. I'm not sure what to do now. I was so excited to finally receive the phone after waiting for so long, but this is unacceptable.\",\n",
       " '  I used this phone for about 2 weeks and constantly was dropped from data. This made the phone essentially useless since several times I could not make a phone call in the middle of town with great reception.

Nothing like buying a new phone and being excited about it and then not having it work most of the time.',\n",
       " \"  Their is currently a nasty bug in Android 11 that affects the Pixel 4a(Including myself). While using a screen protector, you will get phantom touches and unresponsive scrolling. Navigation gestures are unresponsive or erratic. Gesture style keyboards are nearly impossible to use. It really gets bad when the phone gets hot, which doesn't take long at all when you're using it.I've been pulling my hair out dealing with the issue. Hope a fix is coming. Been this way since Android 11 dropped. The Issue was not present in Android 10.Plus side. The camera on the phone is absolutely superb. This thing takes awesome clear crisp pictures. Fast charging and sleek body design. Doesn't feel cheaply made. Speakers are loud and the phone is perfectly sized.This will be a 5 star once Google fixes the sensitivity issue!Update: October security patch just came out and Google fixed the issue. Yaay. I cannot reproduce the touchscreen sensitivity issue.\",\n",
       " \"  Super fast, she is coming from a Samsung S8 and I have the S9. This phone is pretty awesome, we are willing to give up our wireless charging to have a fast phone at a cheaper price. Sucks it isn't at least water proof but we'll take that chance I guess. Anyways wife is happy and I just ordered one for myself.\",\n",
       " \"  I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone, but my wife needed a better phone, so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size.My biggest concern was the screen size difference, but with the slim bezels on the 4a, the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL. You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side, but in practical terms of use, its very neglible.As for the phone itself...I love it! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup, the fingerprint reader is still in place, it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was. While I do have very large hands, the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle, and much easier to operate one handed.Prior to my Pixel 3a XL, I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved. I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones, as well as a few other more budget friendly phones.For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk! Everything you need, nothing you don't.Full Transparency - I am not a gamer, so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming. But beyond that, it works wonderfully.If there is any downside, it is the battery. Not that it's small... I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion. However, with my slightly more than average use, I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening. The good news is that in as little as 15 mins, this thing will charge up 50% or more, so it's not a huge deal. If you are going to go out for the evening, just plug it up while you are getting ready, and you'll be more than good to go!They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone's battery life over time, so we'll see how that goes. But despite that, it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG, especially when comparing to other phones in this price point.Oh, and having just one color choice?? What does that really matter, especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone. There's a good variety of cases to add color, so don't let that stop you.\",\n",
       " \"  This is literally everything I could ever want or need in a phone. I do not give two craps about multiple cameras or 90hz screens. The Pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it's low price point. Double the storage than my last phone, a better camera, better screen, fantastic OS, updates for three years, free google photos storage.. and all for 50$ less than my previous phone!The camera is the selling point for me. It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones, and it's only one camera. Google's software really seriously kicks ass.The touch screen is snappy and I don't find myself wishing it was faster, it responds immediately to touch, scrolls fast and looks vibrant.The screen to body ratio is perfect, really great job removing bezels.The hole punch is not at all irritating, I've had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it. It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it. It is much better than a notch of a bezel. It looks cool I think.The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts. My last phone I only got 64gbs, because in order to get the 128gb version it was $100 more! With 128gbs and free google storage, I can't imagine needing more space ever, really.I'm really enjoying the phone, it's nice to hold even with a case, it's lightweight and pleasant to view and type on. I don't imagine myself getting another phone for at least 5 years. It is an absolute powerhouse of a buy, highly recommend.\",\n",
       " '  The phone came DOA, it wont charge anymore.EDIT: I have read some other reviews and it seems I was not the only one with these energy/battery issues.

       " '  *If you don\\'t want to read my entire review, here is the summary: The Google Pixel 4a is the BEST phone you can buy right now for almost everyone. For $349 it\\'s a NO BRAINER.*I have used several Android phones (including flagship ones that cost $900+) and I\\'ve also used an iPhone. But this Pixel 4a is the absolute best overall experience I\\'ve ever had with any phone. I\\'m a tech guy for a living, so I needed a phone that could do everything and do it well, this phone more than delivered! Did I mention it\\'s ONLY $349?Below is a pros and cons list I\\'ve made for potential buyers. I hope you find it helpful!Pros: Fully unlocked so it will work with EVERY SINGLE carrier in the USA (As well as many outside the US), HUGE amount of built in storage of 128GB, plenty of RAM at 6GB, a fast and energy efficient processor (SD 730G), a bright and beautiful 5.8 inch display (OLED at 1080p+ resolution), a headphone jack! (For those of us who still prefer a wired connection), a decent sized battery (3100+ mah) that gives you all day battery with moderate to heavy use, fast charging included in the box (18W) you get from empty to 100% in about an hour and a half, with close to 50% after 20 mins give or take, dual stereo speakers that sound great, a very good hapitic feedback engine when you type, a phenomenal front and rear camera (literally the best camera on any Android phone), really premium feeling polycarbonate (plastic) body, really sturdy and clicky buttons, and the absolute best software experience by Google with at least 3 major Android OS upgrades in the future.Cons: No water or dust proofing, no wireless charging, only available in Just Black color, no 5G support, limited case selection (As of right now but that will change in the future).Overall, the experience of using this phone is fast, fluid, and enjoyable. The screen is bright and almost edge to edge, it\\'s the perfect size for one handed use, the Pixel version of Android is light and easy to use and has many really good exclusive features like \"Now playing\" and \"Live transcribe\" as well as many more new features to come with the newest version of Android and security patches being pushed out directly from Google to their Pixel line of phones. It offers unmatched support and longevity for Android updates and security patches.I\\'ve had this phone for several days and it\\'s my daily driver, I have had no issues or complaints with it at all. The battery life is great, it\\'s super fast and smooth, it doesn\\'t slow down or stutter when I use multiple apps at a time, it doesn\\'t close my apps down in the background too quickly, and it\\'s the perfect size for my hands and pockets. What else can I say? You don\\'t need to spend $900+ to get a really good phone! Just spend $349 and get this phone! You won\\'t regret it.',\n",
       " \"  After just one week, I tried to swipe up to get my apps and nothing happened.  It would only boot into safe mode.  I called up the tech support and they guided me through a factory reset.  It still didn't solve the problem.  The tech rep said we did everything and something was wrong with the phone.  Garbage.\",\n",
       " \"  Initially the phone was exactly what I wanted. Used the phone for a few weeks then it got stuck in a reboot loop then software issues preventing me from backing up my info.So I contacted Amazon. because since the phone won't stay on long enough or I can't back up or erase my personal and important  small business info from the phone I'm not comfortable sending it back.... Amazon won't issue me a refund without returning the phone. I'm not comfortable retuning the phone with my info and accounts open.I tried to explain this to several times to customer service and they told me to contact google. Called google from a different phone and Google customer service is closed because of covid restrictions.  This is BS.  So it's looking like I may be stuck with a $350 paperweight.\",\n",

       " \"  Update on April 1, 2021: I continue to experience volume & sound problem - this phone does NOT ring to alert me of INCOMING phone calls & INCOMING wechat calls.  OUTGOING calls I can hear the ring tone.  Sound does not always work during zoom call -- in my opinion, this phone is unnecessarily complicated with lots of google stuff.Today (Dec. 29, 2020), the volume button stopped working again.  I hope it will come back and start working again. This has happened a couple times so far, each time, before I called, the volume button started working again.  voice command could also be easily triggered on this Pixel phone, and this annoy/unwanted feature definitely can drive people nuts.There is NO USB-C Cable with this phone order, and I did not have one at home.  I called seller's support line, but was told google store sell this USB-C cable for about $20.  This was NOT convenient & NOT nice!  A C-to-C cable was included, however, with C on both end,  I could not plug it to my portable charger nor laptop.The Pixel 4a camera takes good photos when night sky is dark  -- however, if you want to include the moon in photo, there is always a GREEN DOT in the picture near the moon.Wechat talks via this phone is super clear.\",\n",
       " \"  I bought the Pixel 4a after using a Pixel 2XL for two years. There are a lot of wonderful features within the 4a, but I am just not as impressed with it as I was hoping. For the price, it is a stellar phone. It's fast, it's pretty, it doesn't look as cheap as it is, and I honestly can't say anything back about it - besides 2 things.Even after using my 2XL for two years, the battery life is still better than the 4a. I find myself charging the 4a several times a day, whereas I rarely had to charge my 2XL once thought the day.Also, the camera. It is SO fuzzy with the front camera, and the rear camera honestly didn't blow me away. I'm a professional photographer, so I'm a bit snobby about the camera on my phone.Honestly the battery life for the 4a is just okay. If you want a cheap, high quality phone that packs a punch and a half, get this one. I personally am returning mine and buying the 4XL in hopes I'm more satisfied!\",\n",
       " '  I used this phone for 2 weeks with a lot of pleasure. It is fast, makes beautiful pictures and lasted me all day. However, I went running with the phone in my hand and a bit of sweat got on it. The next day the whole screen was blue and black. So a good buy for the price, but be very careful with water.',\n",
       " \"  UPDATE:  Google released another update which fixed the touchscreen issue.ORIGINAL:  Loved the phone until the Android 11 update. Now, with a screen protector installed, the touchscreen is too sensitive and the phone is unusable. Works ok without the screen protector, but that risks permanent damage to the screen.It's a known issue and Google had had weeks to fix it.\",\n",
       " \"  I got this to replace an aging Note 5, which itself was a replacement for a Nexus 5.  I never quite felt like the Samsung version of android was something I enjoyed, and I was looking forward to returning to the stock experience I had with the N5, and this one fit the bill.Sure, it doesn't have a few features I was hoping it had, but the honest truth is...did I really need them?For the price ($350 at the time of this review) there simply isn't anything remotely close in my opinion, and I am truly enjoying the experience with this. The fingerprint reader is just practically instant, and the placement on the back is the right place for it. I always hated the Samsung's button fingerprint reader, and it seemed like a crap-shoot whether it would work or not. this one is just darn solid.Camera is great, and the battery life is just unbelievable.Unless you -absolutely- need some of the missing features, like the wireless charging, wide-angle camera or the faster-refresh rate, then this is the one to get. If you do feel like you need those, do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them...This isn't just a great phone for $350, it is a great phone full stop, and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point, I will never shell out $1k+ for a phone ever again.I didn't get it through amazon as it was sold out, but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended. I just love that feel of the cloth-like texture and wish I could get something like that for my iPad. And it is washable!\",\n",
       " '  Phone is great but the speakers were fuzzy and distorted. I think I just got a bad one, awaiting my replacement.',\n",
       " '  The two great things about the pixel are it\\'s price point and camera. Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten.The main issue is the screen sensitivity, I have medium sized hands and fingers (size 9-10) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting. I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard. It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection.Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties, poorly implemented, or downright dysfunctional. The gesture controls are chaotic. Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it. Trying to scroll down through a long article... nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app. Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo, nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they\\'ll wonder what you were trying to show them.So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait.. they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square \"Overview\" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming.I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation.Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non-intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone. Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode. Yes you can\\'t shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want. Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you\\'ll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on, touch screen gloves are thin and don\\'t work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues. Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow-mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen. It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots.I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren\\'t available for this one. Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well.For now I am going back to my old phone (a very unsupported, cracked, and dull LG G6) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options, I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach.',\n",
       " \"  This was a great phone. Full stop, great phone.However, after the recent Android 11 update, the phone is UNUSABLE with a screen protector. The touchscreen is now too sensitive, registering taps when you're scrolling and not letting you smoothly use the phone... For anything.This is NOT an isolated issue either. There are hundreds of reports of the same issue on Google's support site. The worst thing is Google knows about this issue with Android 11 but hasn't done anything to fix it for weeks.So if you plan on getting this phone and using it with a screen protector, DON'T EXPECT IT TO WORK.Pixel 4a + Android 11 + screen protector = garbage.\",\n",
       " \"  I've used this phone for a full day. The cameras are fantastic, the display is good (but small for my taste). Haven't used the battery too much (+ the google battery AI hasn't been trained yet), so can't judge on that. The extra RAM here is great -- I went through my social media, then went back to a heavy game (GTA SA) and it was surprisingly still in memory! I've noticed the phone gets really hot throughout the day, especially when you're charging and using it for video calls. The phone even said that it would start disabling features due to overheating. So maybe avoid charging the phone and using it. That's the only bummer I've had with this phone -- that aside, this is a fantastic budget phone.\",\n",
       " \"  The Pixel 4A is for sure waaayoverrated! I have the Blu Vivo XL4 and much of the 4A is very similar to it! The one feature I hate on the my Blu is the call dialing UI. If an error is made in dialing it can't be corrected, you must start all over again! The 4a has the same exact dialing UI..Apps missing can't reinstall most, Screen is dim even at maximum brightness with high intensity with night light turned off! The 4A has a few improved features and a lot of bloat to disable and block tracking your activity. I was happy to get a new phone with better calling features only for this pixel 4a to have the same calling UI as the $150 Blu phone for $200 more! Ugh ugh. I was stunned! That was the one main thing I was anxious to get rid of!!! A major deal breaker!\",\n",
       " \"  So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader. It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in. I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it's really great it's much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one. What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner. I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn't realize how much more uncomfortable it is. Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it's such a beast in such a tank. Whereas this new phone it's thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it's in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I'm holding it like cut. Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb. The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn't take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it's slimmer. I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I'm still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine. My only thing is yes the battery does last all day, my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex-charge and the battery was supposed to do that. But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery. So that's easy for me to be like oh okay well I'm going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now. But I typically only charge it at night when I'm going to sleep. it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn't realize was a thing and I've had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam. So that has been really nice. I also like that I can give names to my group chats. Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I'm used to. it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn't figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I've found. my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that's fine because I can see them fine I haven't looked to see if I can change that. So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don't have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don't have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app.my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I'm just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart. Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive.another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it's my bedtime if I'm staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it's bedtime. I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I'm sleeping so my phone isn't ringing or anything and I don't have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that. Unless of course it's emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10-15 minute window that it will ring because it's a priority call and I have that turned on. I haven't even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone. Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do, so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually. As for phone calls and stuff I don't have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures.this one does say that it's for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile, and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn't. I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then, I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else. But here's the thing even though that they wouldn't help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service. I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it's just I think it's like $12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don't use data I don't have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so. So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka! My phone actually works really well I didn't have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it's not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity, and then if it works great if not I'm sorry you'll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn't work but mine works and I've been doing it for two months now and haven't had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven't had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone.I hope my review has been helpful.

       " \"  I'm not a fan of this phone.  Might return it, but what a hassle!It’s a good-looking and comfortable phone.  Battery lasts for about 4-5 days.  And it was much, much cheaper than other phones.  (hmmm, wonder why?)First and most importantly, it constantly tell me I have no signal.  I haven't moved, and have been with my carrier for many, many years, and this phone is the only phone that can't find the signal.  Constantly.  As in most of the time.Usage is not intuitive.  It does many other very annoying things, and I can’t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things.  I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel.  Um, already done – where’s the user manual?  There is no user manual – too bad, so sad.  Also, a search of google, ironically, reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop.  It is possible this phone is customizable, but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out, and they’re sure as stuff not going to tell you.Bottom line for me was money.  Calls generally work ok, as does text.  But email?  Holy C, you'd think I was asking it to do something easy!  I have to slog through a full crap-load of automatic and unwanted questions (can’t answer the call without a question about contacts, can’t read a text without question about contacts, etc.) before I can do the common things.  I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all?  So annoying!I also wish it had a home button as I'm forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which, as far as I have learned to date, appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts.  Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out.  If I want to read and respond to the next email, gotta start anew from the home screen.  Stupid.Would not buy this phone again, although I think google could easily fix the operating system.  I wonder if they ever will, though.  Doubt it.  Very disappointing.\",\n",
       " \"  Great, responsive phone but it keeps plummeting!  Keep it on a rough surface so it doesn't walk off on you!Not sure what is going on but I keep finding this phone on the floor.  A few times I've actually caught it in the act, just slipping off a surface that I've laid it on, so I've started to put it inside a box or other lipped surface to keep it from walking off.  I suspect the screen and slight lip might be enough to reduce the friction so that even small vibrations can send it off in some direction but I've never caught anything actually doing it, and I didn't have the problem with my old phone (maybe it liked me more?)  It's a cute source of jokes in my house.I've had the phone for about a week and a half and so far am liking it a lot.Pros: Nice weight, good responsivenessCons: Misinterprets light touches, turns off while looking at it.The cons might be something I just need to hunt down settings for.  It seems to be over sensitive when I try to swipe.  It's often drilling down to the next screen when I don't want it to.  It has also shut the screen off during a few tasks, so it is a lot different than my previous phone.That being said, it has the features that I like and is wonderfully nice and responsive, even if it does like skydiving a bit too much.\",\n",
       " \"  Phone stopped working after first charge.  The battery got charged but for some reason it wouldn't load up completely.  I wanted to like this phone but I had to return it.  Maybe I received a lemon but I've been put off enough to where I don't want to take a chance on another Pixel.  They do software well but for hardware I think I'm going to stick with one of the conventional manufacturers.\",\n",
       " '  I have been a Motorola phone fan for quite a while. The Moto X, G, and Z series are all stellar phones. I switched, though, and here\\'s why:- Rear Fingerprint Sensor. I\\'ve gotten comfortable with this on my last Moto so I kept it.-Prox / RF reader. I can tap to pay with this phone as if I had my card. This means I don\\'t need my wallet at a gas station!-Headphone Jack. This is on the Motos too, but it\\'s an absolute NECESSITY for me and my dozens of headphones.-Google support, it\\'s seamlessly working with my computer and my Google accounts.-HUGE internal storage. 128Gb is nice and it\\'s all internal, so no app slowdown. The lack of an SD card hurts, but I haven\\'t needed it yet, and it\\'s been months.It\\'s also completely smooth. It charges fast. It\\'s perfectly sized for me. And the screen is noticable \"prettier\" than my Motos.I say if you\\'re not sure about this phone, let this be the confirmation that you won\\'t be disappointed unless you need a gaming phone.',\n",
       " \"  I'm glad to have a pure Android experience again with no carrier bloatware and no stupid system modifications from manufacturers like OnePlus. (They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps).The camera is fantastic! It's half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor. It's great in low light. The Night Sight mode is so much fun! On a tripod or some other stable surface, astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos. The real-time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice. Basically, you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto (like the bright part of a sunset) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light. It's wonderful!It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it, so that's cool. Lots of nice little updates in that.The default gesture navigation doesn't work well with 3rd party launchers. (I use Nova Launcher). When I swipe up to go to the home screen, I can't tap any icons for 1 second. They don't respond. It's weird. But with the old school 3-button nav it works fine. Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app, then it reopens it. That might be part of that problem. Neither of these things happen with the default launcher, but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar, so I don't like it.The CPU/GPU is plenty fast for me. I don't play much mobile gaming. Just some board games sometimes. The AI in Waterdeep takes it's turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T, so that's nice.Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me.You get a lot of phone for the price!\",\n",
       " '  My old iPhone SE died and i upgraded to the Pixel. It works, but I wish I would have bought the new SE instead. Battery life is good, camera is nice, it works as a smartphone, I like that it still has a headphone jack, but I expected more.The screen doesn\\'t always respond (I try to expand from my home screen to view all apps, but it won\\'t expand). I\\'ve already had to force restart it when it got stuck in an infinite startup loop (had it for only a month). I trained \"ok google\" for my voice, but it never works, however when I was listening to an audiobook in the car, for some reason the name \"Able\" activated google voice every time- super annoying. The first day, the alarm clock didn\\'t go off (found out this is a known issue), and I was late for work. The top volume on the speaker is laughably quiet, so don\\'t expect to be able to talk on speakerphone in the car. I can\\'t seem to configure my work and personal stuff to be on the same screen (it forces me to segment them, so I have two gmail apps and two calendar apps - might be cool for some folks, but I don\\'t like it). The fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone for your pointer finger, which isn\\'t ergonomic at all. Google maps is slow to respond to route changes.I\\'m not a die hard Apple person, but I\\'ve found the iphone SE from years ago to be superior in nearly every way. In 2020 at this price point from Google, I expected more, now I\\'m stuck. I do not recommend this phone.',\n",
       " '  I love this phone! My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it, but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems!The camera is amazing, and has a lot of great settings and options. I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality. The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone.I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a, but not a lot of other phones, and I enjoy having that option.The fingerprint reader works great.The battery lasts a very long time. I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80% to preserve battery life. Even with all the usage, I usually only have to charge it once a day. It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there.The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was \"it\\'s a great budget phone\" and I 100% agree. I\\'m no tech expert, but as a regular user, I can say this is the best phone I have ever had.In comparison with the Pixel 4 (which I do not have), the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack, but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature, and is not water-resistant.I have the phone in \"Just Black\" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button.There were originally no navigation buttons and the phone directed me to use gestures but I was able to get the navigation buttons that I prefer in the settings.Overall it\\'s a great phone and I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " \"  I've been a fan of the Google phone since they released the original Nexus phone over a decade ago. I've been through the good and the bad, and can confidently say that the 4a is one of the best Android phones that I've seen offered from Google.The phone has enough processing power to run the most recent Android operating systems and enough storage for my needs. The battery life is at the top of the pack for Android phones and the camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures. USB-C charging is fast and the phone works well with third-party chargers. I've had no issues pairing it with my car or headsets and transferring over all of my data from my previous phone was a snap.One *really* nice feature of this phone is that it is dual-SIM capable; you can have both a virtual and a physical SIM. If, like me, you carry a phone for work and a personal phone, you can consolidate down to one device and choose which carrier you use for your outgoing phone calls, and data, while being able to text and call from either number.If you are in the Android ecosystem, this is the phone to get.\",\n",
       " \"  I bought the Pixel 4A (Not the 4A 5G) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated. Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn't get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous. When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn't un install which I don't like one bit. The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps (Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air) and the apps that can't be uninstalled like Google assistant (Which is part of the OS) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy. I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don't want. Unlike many people I don't use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great!  The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase!! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone!\",\n",

But there are several negatives you should be aware of:Battery life - OK, but not greatProcessor - OK, but not greatDisplay - looks great but there is an area about 10 - 20 pixels big all around the right edge and bottom where the phone does not register any touches. Very annoying in games and any app with buttons way at the right/bottom.The Pixel Launcher takes a huge chunk of the display for Google to use as they please (can be fixed by switching to the Nova Launched, but it's annoying to have to do that)Not water proofNo wireless chargingI really like the smaller size and can live with the problems for a couple years, but I'll be upgrading in 3yrs...UPDATE: Added 1 star - the biggest disappointment for me was the dead-to-the-touch zone around the edge, it turns out that was caused by Android 11 gestures. Once I changed the UI to instead use the 3 buttons (Back\\\\Home\\\\Nav) at the bottom, that problem went away.\",\n",
       " \"  I have the original Pixel XL and almost upgraded to the 3a XL last year, but the reviews didn't convince me it was worth it.  I just kept using my phone until I found what I thought would be a nice upgrade.  The 4a is the right phone for me at the right time.  The cost was so tempting given the specs, I didn't blink.  I got it from Amazon only 3 days after official release.  I love it.  Nothing about it feels inferior to the Pixel XL.  I was able to connect a USB-C cable and transfer my files and settings in about 20 minutes.  I also connected to my main Win 10 machine and updated my music on the new phone and everything went without a hitch.  I found this upgrade process so much easier and smoother than when I upgraded the two family I-phones (6+ and 7+ to 11) Christmas 2019.  Once I set everything up I checked performance and found the new 4a very snappy.  My use is mostly web browsing, email. news, a bit of shopping and Facebook.  Nothing challenging, so I loaded up YouTube TV and watched it in small and full screen while I transferred some of the music files.  I saw no slow downs in playback or the transfer.  From my limited testing around the home office, the camera is pretty nice.  The speakers are about on par with the original Pixel and about what I expected.  The speakers sound fine. With a headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, better sound is simple enough to remedy. I know this isn't in depth or a long term review, but in the 24 hours I have had this phone its been great.  I have gotten good battery life too.  Thanks Google for a great phone and Amazon for getting it to me.\",\n",
       " \"  Google claims phone battery last 24 hours, not even close. 12hours max so far with data and bluetooth turned off and shuting down some other bells and whistles. I don't use my phone much. Spotify check out FB. I haven't given the camera a test yet. I switch off the annoying gestures and put the home button on. It's easier to navigate that way. I hate that the charging cord is c to c on both ends. That means you need to take your charger with you. Stupid. Great my car has USB plugs I can't use. I looked into getting a fast-charging USB to c cord but the cord mfg didn't recommend it for the pixel lines. Btw this phone listens to you all the time. Even with google voice turned off. Spotify has crashed twice so far with this phone. I didn't have that issue with my Samsung active 7\",\n",
       " \"  While I love the latest Android OS and how responsive this phone is, as well as its great battery life, the phone has one fatal flaw that you need to be aware of. The phone is extremely sensitive to the presence of moisture, and for many of us, it has died in circumstances that any other phone would do just fine in. Mine died when I had it in the pocket of my waterproof ski pants for 2.5 hours on the ski slope, on a rainy day. The pocket was zipped closed the entire time, and I didn't remove the phone from the pocket until I was in my car. The pocket was not wet inside, even the tissue in the pocket was dry. However my phone's display, when turned on, lit up, but was unresponsive to touch. A day later the same. I can see a very slight haze of humidity on the inside of the selfie lens. I suspect the high humidity in the pocket was enough to short out the screen. Buyer beware - I recommend you Google the issue before purchasing.\",\n",
       " \"  I was using the Pixel 3 previously. Processing power-wise it was a down grade but bought this phone because my pixel 3 was starting to stutter at times and I just loved the way the display on the Pixel 4a looked. After receiving the phone- the phone felt really nice on the hands: outer plastic shell didn't feel cheap nor plasticky as many youtube reviewers stated(feels solid to me atleast). Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation(going back gesture).- full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected(the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode). Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would've been better if the gap was shorter.- also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious.- haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part.- apps not supporting the display ratio/size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display. Also, the status bar part is unutilised on all apps, which is a bummer but again not critical.- photo takes a split second more to process/save right after taking one, but besides this occasion I don't feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3(probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don't game with my phone so no complaints on processing power).Overall, really enjoying the display and the design.\",\n",
       " \"  I have small hands. Most of the phones out there are big now. And I am looking for a small phone that is not premium or flagship priced. And Pixel 4a meets that need. Since there are already excellent reviews in YouTube and Amazon, I will just add my personal experience with the phone. Pixel 4a fits nicely in my hand now. I can use the phone with one hand without fumbling it. My previous phone Moto G7 while great still was a little big for my hands. I do not support iPhone ecosystem, so I was looking for Android. My wife's phone Pixel 3a was great in my hands so I thought I would check out Pixel 4a and it has bigger screen yet smaller than 3a! So I grabbed it and using it for a month, I am really satisfied. Size and weight are perfect and the performance is more than I need (I am not a gamer, so I don't need a powerful processor). The screen is OLED and is clearly better than IPS LCD screens. The colors are just more rich and pop out than IPS LCD. Battery lasts more than 1 full day (my average screen time is between 3 - 4 hours). And the camera! Wow... It is really good. I've heard it was good, but actually seeing it - I was really impressed. The ONLY thing I wish Pixel 4a had was: Water and dust proof feature (IP 68). But for $350, this phone is amazing. And you also get 3 year software update guarantee. So if you are not looking for a premium phone, but something small yet powerful and takes great pictures, then Pixel 4a is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " '  I have always had expensive iPhones (over $1 K), but now that I am retired I cannot afford that kind of money for a phone. I am also totally SICK of Apple, as their security on phones and iCloud is so extreme and bizarre that I have wasted many hours on their help line. Did you know that if Apple mistakingly thinks you are in Hong Kong, they will change your entire phone to traditional Chinese? That took me 5 hours on the phone to rectify. And puzzles me ... even if I WAS suddenly in Hong Kong, I would NOT suddenly start reading and speaking in traditional Chinese. In any event, I could not take the stress any more, so I decided to take the BIG step of divorcing Apple and moving to Android. I expected to have a big learning curve, but I just watched a few YouTube videos, and the transition was seamless. Within 24 hours I was IN LOVE with this phone. The screen is gorgeous, the speed is more than good enough, the battery life is awesome, and the apps are marvelous. It can do EVERYTHING my iPhones used to do. The difference is that downloading my photos to my computer is easy and a sheer pleasure. I NEVER get locked out because, for example, I have travelled to Mexico and suddenly Apple is suspicious of me. Oh, and the camera is super important to me. That is why, after a lot of research, I chose this particular phone. Well, the camera is outstandingly excellent. I am thrilled about the astral photography. For a third of the price I paid for my iPhone 6, I now have a camera that is about 3x better. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone - the best one I have ever had in my life. And this is coming from someone who has had decades of flagship phones from Apple. I feel sorry for all those who still think that nothing but an iPhone would do. I would rather go back to pay phones than ever own an iPhone again.',\n",
       " \"  I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else. I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro, Samsung S20 FE, Realme 6 Pro, Samsung S20 FE again, and now the Pixel 4a. I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel. The instant security and OS updates, compact form factor, ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google's online tool, excellent battery life, and bloat free, fast software experience are what make Pixel the best. I commonly get 6.5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on. Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme, they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers. Samsung even though they have the best hardware, OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin. I was GLAD to lose the superior screen, speakers, 5G, 120Hz, and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better. I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones. Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for. In my experience, 5G in my area is really not better, if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone. The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas. For this reason I'd choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen. The 4a should have been $299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides. Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time.\",\n",

If would of knew that, then I would off not bought this phone.The reason I bought this phone because it was small and compact. But I had to buy another phone that would ring so I could answer my calls for business. I would not recommend this phone to anybody because this seems to be a major issue for this phone.

I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame. The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a (and a little unwieldy if the truth be told)  but to my mind the smaller size of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle, certainly one-handed. Though smaller in overall size the whole-screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it runs a bit faster than the Motorola too.

I struggled to get a clear closeup or sometimes even distant photos with the Moto. With this phone I am amazed, I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels. I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly. I couldn’t have done that with Moto it just wouldn’t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it’s a defect numerous people have. With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don’t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic. Thanks Google. I like google everything it just works! Thank you! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc. I couldn’t do that before! The camera is important to me because I don’t carry my big digital camera anymore it’s just to much hassle. I want a nice clear picture taking camera that’s easy to use and quick! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn’t have before. Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works! I haven’t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos, love it. I’ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives, discs and flash drives and a scanner. Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos. I’m sold, I use Google for everything now. I’m 65 and this digital apps, camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do. The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use.

       " '  [May 7, 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a, ordered November 8, 2020 and used daily ever since]PROS:Form factor and weight-This is the best marriage I have found. Fantastic screen real estate, sensible (ideal?) resolution, and just terrific dimensions for me. This thing is light weight for its size, and I love that more than I can possibly express. Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated. Give me plastics, baby! I have no desire for metals that don\\'t add to functionality (and apparently, from something I saw on YouTube, this phone is insanely rugged, even with a plastic shell). Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices, and it\\'s just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset, IMO. I think Apple charges $550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones. This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $200 less than the price of Apple\\'s back glass repair.Price:Performance-While I can\\'t compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm, I am never wanting for speed. This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day-to-day needs. The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid-range Qualcomm shine. I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE, and both proved plenty fast for anything I do; this 4a is no exception.Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones. No real surprises. My day-to-day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I\\'ve noticed. I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a.I don\\'t game. Well, I play some chess now and again, including occasional analysis using very demanding engines (Stockfish, etc), but in general I can\\'t comment on gaming performance.Battery-Battery life and charging time have been lovely. I seldom charge to 100-percent, instead I prefer to just give little 5- to 15-minute charges periodically during the day, while keeping the battery in the 30- to 70-percent range where possible. This thing charges way, way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather (very unscientifically). I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own.Camera-It\\'s so good it doesn\\'t even make sense. Shooting stills, the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn\\'t hold a candle either. I think that\\'s being objective. I\\'ve had quite a bit of low-level, professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs, and I\\'m quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a. The software image processing is pure magic.I have kids, and they\\'re the important subjects for me. I\\'d guessed the 4a might struggle with motion, particularly in lower light, which would have been a deal-breaker for me, but this thing takes \"keepers\" practically every single time. Glorious. Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non-moving subjects, so I won\\'t carry on about that. It\\'s an exciting camera experience. Concerning video, the 1080p 30- and 60-frame shooting has not disappointed either, and the image stabilization is truly excellent. I don\\'t mess with 4k on phones (yet), so no comment there. I don\\'t take selfies, so I won\\'t comment on the front-facing camera either.Android-The gesture navigation is fantastic, particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left- or right-hand side of the display. Massively convenient and easy on the hands.Updates/security patches are crucial for me, and with a Pixel, scorching fast updates are what you get, and support duration bests most Android-based OEMs.Fingerprint recognition-Works as well and as fast as any I\\'ve experienced. Thought the rear placement would bug me. It absolutely does not. Rear placement is probably my preference now. Well executed. I like.CONS:Audio volume/intensity-The 4a just doesn\\'t get as loud as some other modern handsets. It\\'s tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I\\'m doing dishes, for example. That said, the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory, to me.Google Search-There\\'s a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen. I leave mine there and find it useful. When tapped, you\\'re presented with the ability to \"search apps, web, and more...\" (much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top). Google/Android learns over time, so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you\\'re most likely to want. Works great, more often than not. But the problem for me is that it\\'s inconsistent with regards to displaying apps. It must be that about 20-percent of the time it doesn\\'t display apps, so I\\'m forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface, then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query. I can\\'t figure out what causes this for the life of me, and I\\'ve owned an IT MSP for years, so this ain\\'t my first rodeo with tech devices! Frustrating, but muscle memory makes this only a half-second affair to correct.Dependability-I\\'ve long used the same MVNO for cell service, which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it\\'s of importance here: I\\'ve found a few occasions where I can\\'t place phone calls. To fix, for some reason, a reboot was required. I haven\\'t had any issues in the past few months, but it\\'s probably because I\\'ve changed habits; now, whenever there\\'s an update to something low-level from Android (not just a basic app update), I reboot the phone. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?? Anyway, I\\'d have a \"need\" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months, outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update. To have had to monthly (or maybe even more frequently) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls (with no warning as to any trouble, unless I attempted to place a call and \"connect the dots\") is unfortunate. I don\\'t like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time.OLED-I\\'m sensitive to flicker, so I basically hate OLED. My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker-free (no PWM). This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while. On the 4a, unless you\\'re at max brightness (exactly 100-percent), you can expect flicker in the ~122 to 255Hz range. That\\'s too low for me. I would prefer an LCD, like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE. I could view those endlessly without fatigue- read books on them, you name it. But the industry does trend, and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days {rolls eyes}.Overall:This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I\\'ve ever found in a cell phone, and I\\'ve owned many of them since 1994. I\\'m highly satisfied with this handset, and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a. Google has made a proper phone for adults.9/10 DO recommend!',\n",
       " '  I\\'ve had my phone a couple of months. It replaced a Moto Droid Turbo 2, which was a great phone. I chose the 4a in part because it\\'s a smaller unit. I don\\'t want a cigar box in my pocket. The compromise was on how narrow it is -- a bit too narrow, less screen, not as substantial in the hand. But those are tradeoffs. Nice to have a clean Android install and updates!PROSComfortable sizeGood displayResponsive and smooth actionBattery life is excellent - I get 2-3 days but watch little video, play no games, keep location off unless I need itCamera has pretty good night modeI don\\'t use a \"wrapper\" on my phone - it slides in/out of pocket easier \"bare\". Dropped it once, no damage. Fingers crossed.(I don\\'t use face recog or fingerprint reader)GREAT price!CONSA bit too narrowDisplay is not as good as the reviews would have you believeDitto on the camera -- I\\'m not very happy with it. The controls are clumsy, including the exposure hotspot.I really miss the Turbo 2\\'s \"wave your hand\" to see notifications. Seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phones.Screen is slow to populate when bootingIt\\'s probably Android or the app, not the phone, but it often plays the wrong ringtones on the alarmThe only other phone I considered seriously (I looked at a lot, \"in person\"!) is the Samsung S21 (not 5G) at a higher price. If I were to do it again I might be swayed to get that instead. The camera is just better as is the screen. But I\\'ll be honest -- $349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat! Unless your phone is a really big deal to you, the 4a does the job nicely.One last thing: I\\'ll never buy another locked phone again!',\n",
       " \"  While I work in the space of mobile applications I tend to hold off on upgrading my phone until the last minute of my phone's life. Upgrading to this from the OG Pixel was a great transition. There were things about the other Pixel phones that I didn't like so I waited until one had what I needed. Headphone jack, thank goodness. I'm old and still love having this as an option because I have older equipment here and there that it's just a lot easier. Fingerprint reader on the back of the phone again; this is one thing that the OG Pixel had that I really loved. It became second nature so I really wanted it back. The battery life on this phone is fantastic so far. I would say with moderate use I could probably get 2 days out of it on a charge. It also charges fairly quickly. For performance, it does exceptionally well for the  price range and it's all I need. The camera takes pretty great pictures, and does well with portrait mode even better than the iPhone SE. (It recognizes my dog so I'm happy haha). The only downsides to this phone for me would be no wireless charging and it is not 5G ready. I knew this going into it and honestly I can't live without those things for another couple of iterations. The phone is very intuitive and a great experience.\",\n",
       " \"  So I was slightly skeptical about this phone. Some of the reviews worried me a bit. I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself. Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a. I unfortunately didn't do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7. I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well, and no I didn't. So this was like a really nice upgrade for me. I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn't get past a year with that one. So I'm a heavy phone user from streaming, games here and there, camera and social media. I'm not some tech genius but I do my research. Let me tell you some things I love about this phone.Standout Pros-- The price!-The camera, it's absolutely fantastic. I can't get over how much I love it. My photos on my old phone were terrible. Now I can't stop taking pics.- Minimal bloatware. Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great.- How light it is. Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep. This is a great weight.-The features, I love some of the great things this phone can do. Such as the picking up of music around you. There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all.Cons--Extremely crappy case selection lol. Literally that's the only con I have so far and it's a small one.Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a's battery life. And I have to say it's pretty good. It's about the same as my old phone. It's not insane as I thought it was going to be. It's not a con because it's not bad in any way. Just thought I would mention it's not as mind blowing as it was made out to be. Also I thought I'd mention that my old phone had a 6.2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller. I don't even miss or notice the smaller screen. I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel. But almost immediately I didn't even notice the difference. I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone.The shipping was great from this seller as well.These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me. I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important. I look forward to using this phone for 2+ years at least. I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence!\",\n",
       " \"  After 3 weeks with this phone, I really wanted to like it, it is just too small for my hands, and I have a hard time reading things, I have went back to my oneplus 7 pro.Battery life was AWSOME!! 8+ hrs screen one time on a charge, if I used it normally it would last more than 24hrs on a charge.love the basic Android, and the fingerprint scanner was FAST.I guess it's just not for me\",\n",
       " \"  I love this phone. Please keep in mind, I've never owned a flagship phone, usually sticking to phones I could buy outright for less than $200.That said, I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research. I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it. So the following are my impressions:First off, what's different from the Pixel 4: You are missing the aluminum frame, the facial recognition, the edge squeeze, the water resistance, a specific camera lens and some camera features, wireless charging, and an 800 series processor. I think that's about it.The thing is, other than the water resistance, I personally don't miss any of that.What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen, a better battery, and a brighter screen (you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work). This is also a fair bit lighter. Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition.For me it's the perfect little phone. Full disclosure, I paid about $260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse. Nonetheless, this phone hits all the right spots for me. It is light, it has a clear and bright screen, it is fast, takes amazing pictures, it isn't bloated with preinstalled apps, and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years, the sound is pretty great, and honestly I can't find much to complain about.The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance. Accidents happen. Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen. Buy a case. Buy a screen protector. If you do, I can't see why this phone won't be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles, in which case, why are you even reading this review?One last thought. The battery is fine by me. I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use. No wireless charging, but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour, so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I'm good to go. Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don't want to be disturbed anyway.Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4, chose to go with this instead (mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim). Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone!\",\n",
       " '  This phone is absolutely perfect. I used to have an iPhone until I got the 3a last year. I was hooked. Now they took what made the 3a amazing and perfected the it this time with the full screen display. Impressed with how Google focused on the important things like camera, smart OS, headphone jack, buttery smooth functionality, finger sensor, and simplicity. Plus its really smart. Satisfied with how they mastered the necessary things and dropped the frivolous features like wireless charging, waterproof, face ID and glass body on the 4a. The camera alone is worth $350. Seriously, go watch reviews. It is absolutely mind-blowing how great this phone is for the price. I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " \"  I purchased my Pixel 4a for a couple of reasons. My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I'd been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one, I'd become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple's phones. Also, as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack. Fast forward four months and I'm using an iPhone 12 Pro Max.. what went wrong?Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The Pixel 4a is a really great phone. Nice form factor, always on display, fast and responsive fingerprint reader, a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system. My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging, which is quickly becoming essential to me. This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart's content, and if you're not entrenched in Apple's ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations. I say 'probably', because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple's ecosystem, however your circle of friend, family and co-workers should be taken into account. What do the people in your life use? If it's primarily iPhone, that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android. In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone. Silly, right? That was my conclusion, and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max.Do I LIKE one more than the other? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium, due largely to the fact that it is... I don't think it's a question of 'like', though. Your phone is more a question of fit for your life, and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a, the fit wasn't quite right. Things may be different for you, but I can stand behind the Pixel 4a as a quality phone and a bargain at its list price.\",\n",
       " \"  It's very disappointed! It's the second time I bought cellphone from Amazon, and will be the last time. It came with a used and even have scratch on the back of the phone. No charger and any accessories in the box. The box was unsealed! Very unacceptable for hundreds dollars New phone. I returned it right away. The first phone I bought from Amazon was defect and I returned it... Really lost faith about buying phone on Amazon.... Definitely won't try again!\",\n",
       " \"  This was quite a step up for me going from a HTC Desire 526 smart phone to the Google Pixel 4a smartphone. I like the fact that it is unlocked. Never buy a phone that is not. In that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice. I've been with Verizon for 4 years now. And they keep giving me perks for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feeds you. Now about the phone itself. I like the fact it had a transfer device with it so transferring my files, pics, and contacts was very easy for me and granted I am not real techie but I can do a few things without help. I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card. Great camera too. I like you can set it to block out telemarketers. It takes very little time to charge it and the charge lasts a very long time. 12 hours approximately depending on what you do with your phone. I am NOT a gamer as I view it as a big waste of time. The phone has limitless potentials. I like the OLED screen too. It's very light and thin which is nice. I do suggest you get a good rubber armor for it which I did. People I talk to ask me what kind of phone I am on now because I sound really good on it. You won't experience drop calls on this phone no matter where you are. I'm 68 years young and hope this will be the last phone I will ever own until the day they put me in a box.  It has a great assortment of ringer sounds to choose from or if you don't want to be disturbed you can set it to that too. Great Wi-Fi too and you can turn it into your own private Wi-Fi hotspot if you choose to do so. Which I think is very cool. I don't think you can go wrong with this phone as like I said before the potentials of what it can do seem to be limitless. Also the learning curve is quite easy and it's an Android. Iphones are just a name and you pay dearly for it. I'll stick to Android phones. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very functional and efficient/proficient phone.  Buy it. You won't regret it.\",\n",
       " \"  After using an iPhone 7 for five years (two of those years with a bulky battery case because a small bend in the chassis meant I could not get the battery replaced) I decided to switch back to Android.  I hate the facial recognition compared to fingerprint, missed having a headphone jack and needing to use a dongle to connect to my car stereo, and I also felt that it really isn't necessary to spend $700+ on a new iPhone.  The iPhone SE is pretty basic for $450 and the $350 Google Pixel 4a seemed like a great choice.Look, you already know that this has a great camera, good screen, good fingerprint sensor, headphone jack, etc. - here is why it's a 3/5 for me.  Even with a case, the screen cracked after falling a few feet onto a hard surface after only five weeks of use.  Amazon covered a screen repair which was really awesome, but there is no reason this phone should be so fragile even with a hard case.  I really don't see this lasting more than maybe two years and I'll likely go back to Apple at that point.  Just too many cut corners here.\",\n",
       " \"  Is the camera super high resolution? No, but the processing is great and you don't need more than 4,000 pixels wide for social media posts. Is the battery super high capacity? No again, but I never need to charge it more than once per day, and at the end of the day I still have 20 hours of battery left. Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn't hold out long, but for my very average usage it's fine. Does it have a fancy glass or metal case? No, but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway. Or they crack.Does it have a punch hole camera? Yes, and here's my only major gripe. I never use the selfie camera, and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen. All of the other apps I have (Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16:9 video. The punch hole itself doesn't even bother me anymore. I just want full screen video in my streaming apps, and it's not even Google's fault on this one.The verdict is that the Pixel 4a is a solid budget smartphone. It gets regular security updates, is probably getting Android 12, doesn't have a terrible app launcher, and isn't going to crack like my glass back Motorola X4.\",\n",
       " '  I have used oneplus 7t pro, pixel 4 Xl, IPhone 11 pro, S20 and finally pixel 4a in that order for the past year. After using the pixel 4a for 2 days, I can easily say this is my favorite phone of the bunch. Very happy with the placement and speed of the fingerprint reader as opposed to the not so accurate one on the one plus and s20 on screen fingerprint. Very happy with the battery life, as opposed to the crappy battery on the S20 with exynos chip. My favorite camera to take photos, just like the pixel 4. Best software experience, same as the pixel 4, and finally it costs 350 dollars, which is only half the price of the least expensive phone on the list!!!! This is by far the best value for money I have ever seen in a phone. Biggest downside was the 60 hz refresh rate after coming from the 120 hz in the S20, but I can\\'t really complain given this is marketed as a \"budget phone\". If you are just looking for the basics in a phone and want consistency, this is the phone to get.',\n",
       " \"  For 3 years I had been waiting for Motorola to come out with a suitable replacement for my old, cracked screen Moto G5 Plus. I waited in vain.  All that were available in the US were gimmicky phones like the stylus. And they got ever larger too.The Pixel 4a is just right.  It fits comfortably in my hand.  It's feels lighter than my Moto. The on/off button is located high on the right side where it is out of the way -- I don't press it every time I pick up the phone. The fingerprint reader is located on the back where it can be operated one-handed, also out of the way so it is not triggered every time I touch the bottom of the screen. There is only an occasional problem with fingerprint recognition, not enough to complain about.  I think they got the basic ergonomics right.The phone screen itself is bright enough to see outside. The calls are clear and volume is good. The screen is sharp.I have no problems getting a couple days regular usage from the battery. The processor feels fast -- I don't have to wait for apps to respond to input.All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone.\",\n",

       " '  I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago. So far I like it. It is very similar to the S7 in overall size, but without the bezels the screen is bigger. Most functions seem similar, I\\'m not sure what the raves about a \"pure Android experience\" are about. I don\\'t trust and don\\'t use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader, so I just gave them a middle star rating. The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit. I\\'ve always used an ATT store to set up my phones before, but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones, despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years. I followed Google\\'s online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine. The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro; it doesn\\'t. It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box. So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable. Overall, I can\\'t see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7, except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does. Why pay $700+ for a \"flagship phone\" when this does the job for half the price or much less? And 5G? Give me a break. Lots of hype and no benefits so far. I don\\'t expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn\\'t work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife\\'s office is.

The notification system is stupid.When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications. If I\\'m the last person to respond why do I need to see my own .message in the notifications?? That\\'s stupid! If I respond the notification needs to go away!If get a bunch of notifications (emails, text) and I swipe them away, more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY. Sometimes they aren\\'t even new. I literally have to press \"clear all\" 3x for the notifications to go away.I also don\\'t like that if I\\'m on a website that I\\'m trying to upload a image to, the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your \"gallery\". By default it brings up \"recent images\" and I think that\\'s dumb. You should be able to choose what it defaults to. Even still when you press on \"camera\" it\\'ll still take you to another screen that you have to press \"camera\" again just to get to the images you took with your camera.These things can be fixed with software but it\\'s super annoying, especiy the notifications. Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year, the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it! STUPID!

The fingerprint unlock is slow. The battery life is so so. I'm not crazy about the weight of the phone, it feels very light almost like I'm holding a toy phone. I'm really disappointed. This is the first AND last Pixel phone I will own. Unfortunately I will have to keep it as I can't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and waiting for a refund and searching for a new phone.

I used 120HZ refresh rate all the time, but quite honestly I don't see a great difference between them.Honestly, I would really hope this phone to have a bigger screen.

After turning the camera apps on, there is a black screen. I need to wait a few minutes to see the image. Even if I see the image, it is blurred and out of focus, and it will get stuck immediately. This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a. I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its camera function is comparable to flagship phones. But when I can no longer use its camera function, it loses its appeal to me. Can’t use the rear the lens is a problem even for daily use. I can't even scan the QR Code.

The interface is not snappy and quick like the YouTube reviewers say it is. It is average. My budget Redmi note 8 pro costs 200 dollars less than this device and it's a better experience. I found the fingerprint reader doesn't always work, when it works it feels like ages to actually unlock. The same thing with entering a pin. It feels like it takes a long time to actually unlock. Who is this phone for? Someone who isn't really on a phone all the time, it's not a powerhouse scrolling Instagram is okay YouTube is okay, the small display is just a let down. I don't know what model the youtubers are showing you because this device is small. Like really small. Like this would be fine for a child. Okay the camera. Beautiful pictures in good light, okay pictures in really low light, now comes the bad part about the camera. In areas that have light but it's not dark enough for night mode the pictures come out noisy and grainy. Like indoors at 4 pm. For $350 I strongly recommend a Xiaomi device.

I get two and a half days out of the battery but I also don\\'t live on my phone. One of the great things is no bloatware, what a nice change. This phone basically set itself up, a bit of a letdown for someone who enjoys \"tinkering\" with things. I do like the fingerprint reader. If it will work on my fingers, it should work for anyone. Great camera, a first for me, settings I expect to find on my SLR not a phone. I really haven\\'t got to try it but I will try to report what I think later on. I would DEFINITELY recommend a case but then I am a big believer in cases. Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone.Edit 02/13/21So it\\'s been a little over a month and my feelings about this phone haven\\'t changed. The camera is fantastic. I\\'m still not going to get rid of the Nikon. It\\'s nice for those moments when you say \"I wish I had a camera\". It seems I find a new feature every day. I would still recommend this to anyone who feels a 1000+ is a bit much for a phone',\n",

It won't let me turn on my hotspot even though I pay for one.  Really disappointed.\",\n",

All I get is that screen or a white screen with the Google logo.  I researched this problem online and have read that it has happened to many others. I am a very unhappy Pixel customer.',\n",
       " \"  Cons: - The Panorama mode is terrible. You can't go up and down, to take a photo of a tall tree, for example.- You cannot do a side scrolling panorama, for example, take a photo of a long shelf to see everything along the length of it. You MUST stay still and tilt for it to attempt a photo - The phone lags and glitches often when deleting a photo or switching from camera mode to video mode- Google Photos is the only app that comes installed for viewing/managing photos; there is no other image galleryAlso - Google just updated app icons so they all look similar to each other and very different from what they were, making everything Google less accessible, more difficult to find. No settings to change app icons back to old version. No setting to change the battery icon to say percentage - hard to read the tiny battery symbolPros -- regular camera is fine, night mode is cool I guess- not having bloat ware, having control over what apps I have or don't have is nice. No more NFL or Facebook stuck on my phone- phone speaker volume is very good for receiving callsOverall feeling pretty blah and annoyed with it. Maybe it would be better if they changed the camera related software. Is it too late to return this? Booooo thumbs down.\",\n",
       " '  My Pixel 2 was a great camera phone but it was showing its age.  I shopped and compared.  I really wanted my next phone to have an optical telephoto lens.  But the few phones that have that feature are at least 3 times as expensive as the Pixel 4a.  If it had a telephoto lens at a similar price it would get 5 stars.  (I don\\'t understand the need for the wide angle lens on other new models of the Pixel.)I could take a \"real camera\" with me, but I have found in recent years that when I do, I still use the phone for most shots.The Pixel 4a does not have the latest engine, but it is still much faster and smoother than my old one.It doesn\\'t have the largest battery, but for normal use battery life has been far better than on my old phone.One great feature of this phone was the easy transfer of files and apps from the old Pixel.I highly recommend this phone.',\n",

       " \"  I have had this phone about a month.  I came from a Moto G5s plus which was a lower end phone than even this one.  So, I figured this would be a great step up as other reviews have said.  The phone does take excellent pictures unlike my previous phone.  However, the manueverability between screens is just cumbersome.  The gesture to see all the screens that are open is almost the same as the gesture to bring up the menu of all apps.  It is difficult to get the back screen gesture to work.  I have to gesture across the screen from right to left two or three times before it responds.  The volume is fairly low even at the highest setting.  For me, this wasn't a great choice.\",\n",
       " \"  I like this phone for 1) up-to-date OS 2) its not huge (its about the same size as the Moto G5 plus it replaced, but the screen is larger because the bezels are smaller) 3)responsive 4)Transferring apps/settings/files from my previous android phone was easy; came with a USB connector for this purpose 5)The OS is starting to incorporate some of the better windows phone features.  Note the time displayed when the phone is idle in the photo.  Also, when the phone wakes up, you go directly to your home screen.  No more wake swipe-swipe to get to something.Cons: gesture navigation is a mixed bag.  I like having more screen real estate, but the back swipe interferes with in-app navigation.  Bluetooth still seems to be a mess, you still can't easily put a shortcut to connect to just one specific device.Other: For me, the battery can last two days with light use, with typical use I'm maybe down to 33% at the end of the day.\",\n",

On average, with consistent use between work and home on a 14 hours day, I charge my phone about once. It can also last without the charge within that time frame. Wonderful sound quality too, which I was apprehensive about at first since my last phone was very popular for it's great sound quality. I dig the customizable interface/themes for your phone. Previously had the ZTE Axon 7, a new Asian tech brand that lasted me a solid 3 years before deciding on this new Google Pixel 4a. I made the right choice when upgrading this fall, and for a very attractive, modest price! I highly recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't want to spend a grand on a new smartphone.  ☺️\",\n",
       " \"  I bought this to replace an ailing LG6. I was most impressed with the setup. I did it all in the car, riding as a passenger. You just connect the old phone and the new one with a cable, switch over the SIM card, and start the transfer. It installs the phone with the new SIM card, no waiting at Verizon to do it and then paying them for the non-service. It transfers contacts, photos, and other content. All the apps are setup for transfer, but it waits until you have WiFi to start the process. Non-sensitive ones came over with passwords transferred, too. Sensitive ones, like bank card, mobile banking, and other security-sensitive apps required you to sign on again. Swiping instead of 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen finally had the best of me, but there is an option to install the traditional 3-button controls, and it works like a charm. Still figuring out some of the features, but I've very happy.\",\n",
       " '  The \"Google Pixel 4a\" is super fast, and the 128 GB is the right mix of storage. This is such a significant upgrade from my last cell phone that got fried when I jumped in the pool with it, a little careless on my part, I will have to be more careful with this one. I\\'ve been using this new phone for almost a month, and I haven\\'t had any problems. Like I wrote, it is super fast and can upload Apps in a matter of moments. Plus, if you are one for not spending a lot of dough on the phone, the cost is most fair for what you get at the end. This is a top of the line phone that is a noticeable improvement from my last one that I had help installing from a family member. Still, we got this phone running without a hitch. I would say you got to know what you are doing. Not saying anyone can do get it to run so quickly out of the box without help. Still, those are the breaks, just know if you are like me, and you do fry our phone, all is not lost if you do buy this one, and you will be somewhat better off in the end if everything goes well. Also, the battery life on this thing is a great plus as well.',\n",
       " \"  I have been using a iphone since 2007 religiously. I went and bought the iphone 12 and after a few days of using it and watching reviews I decided to finally go try a android phone. I bought the pixel 4a started using it right away I haven't picked up iphone since I got the pixel. I absolutely love it!!!! I have gone from team iphone to team pixel and I'm pretty sure this is going to be my main daily driver phone. I love everything about it. (I did just order the pixel 5) so anyone who is thinking about going from iphone to pixel DO IT!!!! The camera is amazing. The battery life is great. The phone runs very smooth and I love everything about it. I haven't found one thing I don't like yet. And being 2020 and having to wear masks the finger print scanner is a most and perfect!!!!!\",\n",
       " \"  The is a great budget phone , that you cannot be mad at. The finger print reader is pretty fast and super secure. This is not a under screen finger print sensor so it unlocks you phone instantly. This phone has a surprisingly small battery but I get exceptional usage out of it. I'm up from 4 in the morning  and doing my usual ig youtube emails and games I usually have 15 percent @7pm. The best thing about the phone is android 11, I am upgrading from one plus 2 with lollipop and the different in os is huge. But it runs so smooth. Apps open and work flawlessly and everything is very quick and responsive for a 350  dollar phone. The only con for me is the screen size , more specifically the width. It took a bit of adjusting from my oneplus 2 which was wider and easier to type on. I make way more typos with this to the point is use the voice typing now more than touch (which wasn't available on lollipop). Overall I am very pleased with this phone, for the money I can see myself using this until the android updates stop. I love my one plus 2 but even with that small con, I don't see myself not using this phone for a long time.\",\n",
       " \"  This phone has become a very good solid phone. I had my doubts about it being so small. I'm coming from. 6.3 inch motorola. For the phones size it is incredibly agile and a small powerhouse. The battery life is decent. On any given day the battery will last me all day with using GPS, calls and texts. I usually end up with 50-35% at the end of the day (depending on how much I use it). The camera is astounding. It is extremely powerful. The night sight and astrophotography settings are fantastic. Standard photos are very detailed texture and skin tone wise. The sound was very surprising, very good on not only low and midrange sounds, but clear high tones. There is a supposed sound amplifier app built in, but doesn't seem to do anything. The screen is great, color is very deep, and vibrant. All in all I was very surprised on everything this phone can do. Oh and not to mention you can actually uninstall apps you don't want that are built in, instead of just disabling then.\",\n",
       " \"  I love Google products. I'm not exaggerating when I say I use them all, both for personal use and as a teacher and scout leader. I bought my first Google Pixel 4a last Sept. 2020. By April 2020 the sensor fingerprint button on the back had broken, I had spent some time on the phone with Google tech troubleshooting the issue, had a major problem with a factory reset (which did not fix the problem). THEN, before getting it into the store, a tiny break on the screen occurred (regular drop, using a case....first time this has ever occurred to me in my entire lifetime of smartphone use, always using the case). When I got it to the store, they wouldn't fix it. They said I would have to pay for both fixes out of pocket...the cost of a new phone. They would not accept the email from Google saying that they would fix the manufacturing issue and let me pay for the other part (the broken screen). I let Google know the response via email and got a total non-response response that did not respond to the problem at all. Then the screen cracked more. Out of time and need a new phone that actually workes for an upcoming trip, I decided to spend the $300 on a new phone so I'd be under warranty for a year. My cell carrier didn't have any Pixel 4a online or in-store, so I bought one on Amazon brand new and it arrived that same day. I'm not joking ... less than 12 hours later, with a case, the brand new phone dropped again ... and broke, worse than the prior phone!! Specs say this is Grorilla Glass 3...that was one of the reasons I bought this phone and a case. I KNOW I'm going to have occasional drops. But this drop was in a case, from 2 feet onto a linoleum style floor. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BROKEN. That's two phones ... one after 7 months use, one after 12 hours. I've never had a phone that worked so well but with such terrible manufacturing that it breaks so much so often. The worst part is that all I have after multiple emails and now two long phone calls with Google is a promise that if I go back to the contractor Fixit store with the FIRST phone they will back the warranty on the button that broke .... so hey, I can pay $149 bucks to fix the broken phone and I'll be back to ONE working phone again, after spending nearly $800 dollars in one year on two brand new Pixel4as ... DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!! Google doesn't stand behind its own product. Major disappointed customer over here.\",\n",
       " \"  I have had my previous phone for a long time and it's just begun to go wonky. I know old phones create a problem at disposal for our planet, so I have been holding onto the old one for many years. In fact, it was my first mobile phone. So switching to a new phone for me is similar to buying a 2015 car with computer and electronics vs my 20 year old car with none. I expect I will be using this for some time without having a clue how to use all its features. So I will just address the basics. The power button is in a horrible place and I am forever hitting it. So that sucks. It is thankfully silver, so at least it is easy to see. And the phone is motion activated, so having the screen light up on pick up is a feature I can get used to fast!👍 Screen resolution is a huge improvement as are many basics. Just had my first spam call and was delighted to have the option to reply with Google's spam filter and messaging that asks the caller to leave their id and message. I saw it in real time as text to confirm it was a caller looking to sell something.  The ring tones are nice too, the message function kinda clunky, system settings were difficult to find, so much so I eventually created a desktop shortcut to access them. The recorded audio quality sounds muffled (when I set up my vm message) and the camera, which I though would be exceptional, oddly interprets some colors. I use it to post pics of my paintings to Instagram, and it couldn't tell the difference between teal and blue. Battery life is good. To transfer data between the new phone and the old was a pain because only after contacting tech support did I find out the enclosed usb cable ONLY works between Pixel phones! They really should include info like that with the cable/instructions and alert you when you buy. I had to buy a new cable for this one time use and wait until I had it in hand before I could transfer my contact list, etc. This phone cost me more than my Dell desktop computer and large screen. I think it's highway robbery what this and other even more expensive phones cost, but it is what it is. The position of the on switch exactly where you hold it, really is lousy design that I have to deal with every time I pick it up.\",\n",
       " \"  Cheap inferior phone (in all aspects) except the camera. And by cheap I mean cheap. The body and screen are decent, however, the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it. 4a is at least a decent(ish) value for money and the camera punches above its weight. I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $650. The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced. I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone. The drop in quality is shocking.If you use the phone as a phone, something designers at Goggle probably don't, you'll want to hurl it through the window soon. It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well. The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines: the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow, faint lines sound fainter etc. Samsung figured this out years back!Similarly, you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones, alarms, media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use. Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use. Then you switch to headphones to play a song. Then someone calls you. Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones!Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality. But for me it is a key function. There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there. Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together. And a good camera. However, the competition caught up with the latter as well. I am still considering selling this phone too. Not happy.\",\n",
       " '  I\\'m coming from a samsung android note 9. Loved my note 9 but turns out I\\'m not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones... Who woulda thought🤔 ... My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing. Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape!. I could have gotten it fixed for around $400 or I could get a different phone. I didn\\'t want nothing hella expensive I\\'m tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I\\'m just not good with phones! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system. I\\'ve been team android forever now I just really don\\'t care for their picture quality though, I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn\\'t for me, however I did love the picture quality, so since I\\'ve tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try!Pros:This phone is cute, little, and light weight phone, but like not so little that the screens no good. The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen. Which is what I wanted  I was over having huge, heavy bulky phones, I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones...Picture quality is awesome! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones!Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one.The backs plastic! Which that was what I was looking for! People complain that \"oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back\"... I don\\'t get it, so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case... Cause that makes so much sense...I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls. I like this so your not stuck with one or the other.battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did.It def seems very durable. I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone, not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed. I\\'ve dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues!Volume is also pretty goodCons:My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots, which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying....I don\\'t like how there\\'s not as much customization as androids would have, such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me.Conclusion:All in all, the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass, thousand dollar phones... I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road. Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are!If your looking for a nice budget phone you won\\'t go wrong getting this one. Would recommend!',\n",

But  as soon as i held it in my hand it felt a little odd ,my Nexus has a flat back and flat cut sides, this is more rounded on the edges and doesn't quite sit in the hand the back is slippery too and feels it will slip out of my hand any moment ..the aspect ratio is a bit odd too and feels narrow, with the aspect ratio the video has to be cut from sides to adjust and the beautiful screen is wasted with two wide dark bands on the side  .My Nexus feels light & grippy  and sits really well in my hand ...maybe i will get used to it but i wish they had kept the aspect ratio and flat sides\",\n",

Great screen, amazing camera, very easy to use and full of features.  The only complaint is no memory card slot for music or photos (not everyone has unlimited data plan).I would say Pixels like this one are the best phones you can get in this price range. People who complain about things like plastic body and other minor things perhaps need to realize they buy $350 unlocked phone, not $900 phone.

I for one wanted a good camera on my phone and this device meets my need. Although video can be better, it is still usable. The still photos are awesome, no complaints there! It's an easy to use phone with good battery life and smooth performance. In my opinion, you are getting more for what you pay for.

Still far an away better than my old phone.modified after using the phone for one week:the battery life is really bad. I docked it a star for that.

I want a phone that is light and small, with a good enough camera. I don't play games on my phone so I don't need no latest and greatest silicones. I don't worry about drops because it's polycarbonate, and I disliked glass backs ever since the LG V30. The Pixel 4a is simple, it's clean, it works, and it runs the latest Android.

       " \"  I really like what Google is doing for the midrange consumers like myself.Coming from a Pixel 2 I was a bit let down about the performance downgrade, despite better battery life.  After some time using the phone I haven't noticed much lag aside from the camera's render time.It takes 5-10 seconds to fully render a new picture which is pretty significant delay.  My images look horrible during the render process and there's no eta shown, just have to keep opening it.  Images look really great after the render is complete but the lack of a timer or indicator of rendering is off-putting.Speakers also sounded significantly better on the pixel 2 but at least I can still hear the 4a's speakers.All other apps run smoothly and my battery life and recharge rate has made this a pleasure to use as a delivery driver with maps open 100% of the time.  There are better options out there for battery life, but with much compromise in other areas.As a former Verizon wireless sales associate and tech nerd I highly recommend this phone if your budget is below $500, at the time of this review.  There are some minor shortcomings of the device but overall I think the sacrifices made to make the phone only $350 are perfect.\",\n",
       " \"  Excellent phone and features. No overlayed brand bloat software, no brand promoted  apps you can't get rid of, no third party branded internet browser you can't uninstall ,and the pure Android runs really smooth and fast.You can add Firefox,Opera,or any browser you wish. Fits well in one hand for single-handed use while still fitting in a pocket.There's probably nothing better in the price range if you need CDMA and GSM ability in one phone.I transferred all settings,contacts ,messages and phone number with the provided cable and was able to use my old sim with no issues. No hassle.I don't understand why this is often compared to flagship phones in the $600 up range -it's not.Google makes others beside the Pixel 4a  if you need 5G or some trendy features.If you are upgrading from a cheaper,outdated OS LG,Samsung,Motorola phone this is a clear winner.Two or three times the ram and most likely double the storage  of your old phone.It does have a plastic back,but it's very sturdy without flex and better made than my LG and previous Samsung that will never offer system updates.. The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11.Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be.The speakers do not rival $800 phones, but they are very good sounding  compared to  $100-250 phones;much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too. Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well,with better speed on wireless..The  single lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in .raw or standard .jpeg like most folks use - far superior color, sharpness, and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP- but note that you can't adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don't need three lenses ,I have a dslr for that.There's an 8mp front camera that performs  well too.There's no SD card slot,and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music.But I don't have any problems with the  128GB. You can swap or copy files to/from a PC or tablet with a 3.0 USBA to usb C cable like any phone; perhaps slower depending on your PC or tablet USB ratings.\",\n",

Bad notifications (none) Never know when messages or voice mail is received--have to manually check.  Google continually send automatic notices and pop-ups to sell more products--can\\'t turn off. When you turn off one function, it will normally turn OFF others, e.g., sound, so you never get notices of calls.  Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone, 5+ by 2+ inches, easier to carry  than the nerd 7\" X 3\" monsters.  I bought it partly for blue-tooth connectivity, which is OK. My LG was 100% more user friendly.I had bought the Apple LS, but it died within a week, so I went back to Android--Big Mistake. Now have to eat $500 to change, LG does not make the small phone anymore.  No one does it seems. My phone hone is used primarily for calls. Do not need an additional pre-installed 45 google apps on the phone that lacks  basic functionality. Google does not understand user design=KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)!!  P.S.  TYPICAL GOOGLE--NO USER DOCUMENTATION--GO TO UTUBE .',\n",
       " '  I didn\\'t need to buy this phone. But it was so cheap that I bought one just to play with a modern Pixel phone.  For the money, this is probably the best phone you can buy, especially on the Android side, and especially if you love that \"pure Android\" factor.Yes, Pixels aren\\'t \"pure Android\", but close enough in a post-Nexus world.  And the Pixel-specific features are outstanding.  Even though the camera isn\\'t the top-tier hardware we\\'d expect from flagships, Google\\'s computational photography is unrivaled.  Compared to my iPhone 11 and older Galaxy S8+, the Pixel 4a absolutely is at least as good, if not better.I bought this phone, however, to test the video capabilities.  No surprise, it\\'s not as good as the iPhone 11.  But again, for the money, it\\'s really good.  Filmic Pro will overheat the phone when shooting in high resolutions and frame rates, but that\\'s expected on Android anyway.The biggest downside for this phone is the screen--it\\'s definitely not bright enough, but it still looks good.  The fingerprint reader is blazing fast, and despite being a much lower power processor in this phone it still holds up quite well to most use cases.Honestly, if you want a Pixel without paying nearly flagship prices, this should be your pick.',\n",

       " \"  I like it a lot, exactly what I was looking for in a phone. It takes high quality photos. The memory/storage is more than sufficient, so I can do way more than my last phone allowed before slowing down due to low memory. Also, I wanted it smaller so it wouldn't weigh as much as the 'phablets' that everyone else likes, fits better for my hands & how I use it. If I want to watch a movie, i would rather cast it from my phone to a smart tv anyway, so it's perfect for everyday life. Fingerprint scanning works seamlessly & I haven't used face recognition yet.  I use my phone for everything, like most of us these days, so it runs constantly & battery life is very good  taking that into consideration. Charges very fast as well. I also like all the little extras it offers, like digital wellbeing that tracks the time u spend online, etc. It's convenient & interesting to know. Just to be clear, I chose this model due to the excellent camera specs, high memory capacity & the size. Everything else is just an added bonus of having a reliable midgrade phone made by Google. I have had many Samsung's in the past & I love them, but ones I looked at were too expensive for what I need & want.\",\n",
       " '  Coming from a Pixel XL v.1, this screen is actually smaller. The measurement corner to corner is not the best way, IMHO, as most companies make the phones taller to increase reported screen size.

I have large hands and still feel like this footprint is perfect-Very capable and efficient 730G chipset (less than 20% slower than the 765G on Pixel 5)Cons-No wide angle or telephoto lens (personally would have loved to see a 3x 12MP lens perhaps?)-No wireless charging or water resistance (though with a C - to - C cable you'd probably still be able to charge your buds)Overall, this phone get's my highest recommendation.

Speed is good and so is the camera. However the screen was cracked within two weeks. Other phones I've had have taken far more abuse and never cracked. This was a drop of about 1 foot. It was in a case. You could blame the case for not being very protective. But what really bothers me is that it can't be repaired.

The only way to eventually reconnect is to restart the phone. Sometimes it take 5-6 restarts.I have had this phone for less than two weeks. I.

       " '  I was extremely torn between this phone and the Moto G Power (2020 version). They are both great phones without bloatware, and top of their relative classes, but I\\'m very happy I paid more for the Pixel 4a. It\\'s smaller, lighter, way better camera, better hardware, more software/security updates, and I prefer Google apps anyway. It has more features than I\\'ll use, but not a ridiculous amount like on the Samsung Galaxy S4 I had years ago. I was nervous about battery life, just because I\\'m used to having a phone with a ridiculous battery, but there are so many settings that extend your battery life on this phone. There\\'s a battery saver mode AND an extreme battery saver mode! I want this phone to last as many years as possible, so I use the extreme mode all the time time. I don\\'t have to charge it but once every 1-3 days. If I used the phone more I would probably have to charge it once a day. I like I can unpause specific apps, while leaving the rest in battery save mode.I was nervous about buying a used (not renewed) phone on Amazon, especially because the one I purchased was only considered in \"good condition, with minor scratches on front, back, and sides\". The phone I received is nearly flawless! I actually didn\\'t notice the incredibly minute scratches on the left side, and bottom right corner of the screen for at least 30 minutes out of the box. They\\'re so small I thought they were dust. There are no marks on the back or sides at all. I couldn\\'t be happier with this phone and I\\'m so glad I saved some money buying it used. I can\\'t speak for longevity, but my bank gives me a 2yr warranty past a phone\\'s release date, and the Pixel only came out Aug 2020. Seriously get this phone if you like smaller phones, if you need a cheaper phone, I would get the Moto G Power(2020 version only!) in a heartbeat.',\n",

I both cases I had to restart the phone manually since even the restart on the screen was frozen. Hope it's just a software issue that can be fixed when google pushes out a newer software version. The rest is fine. I was previously using Huawei smart phone it's a slightly better phone than a pixile for almost the same price, changed because Huawei is no longer supported by many American companies including android and hoogle, so some apps stopped working.

The map is broken when trying to move the map around, glitches and fails. I have to switch to maps to look for locations near me instead of google assistant.As for screen on auto rotate, the phone does not rotate automatically most of the time.

Granted some of them are gimmicks, but you'll be able to impress your friends with a 350USD phone.The camera is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point. The funny thing is it isn't really the camera itself that makes it good. It's all the software that allows 1 camera to emulate the functions of a lot of 4-camera phones. And this emulsion is pretty good.For instance, the portrait mode is able to give that depth is field effect without a depth sensor.I didn't even buy this phone for the camera, so I like the fact that I'm not paying for 6 cameras but I'm still getting the same functions.\",\n",

Other than that it's much the same as any other Android phone.Battery life is pretty good, not as good as phones with larger batteries but you do have to compromise a little when you choose a small phone - there's not much space for the battery in there. I charge my battery to 80% and most days with light use it's at about 40 - 50% at the end of the day. If I use it really heavily it would probably still last the day but it'd be pretty low so I tend to do a top-up charge. The supplied charger tops the phone up really quickly, which heats the phone up a little more than I'd like so I tend to use a medium speed charger most of the time, but it's great if I'm in a hurry.\",\n",

Though this is a new feature with the current Android OS, there is no back button. Yeah I know. I miss it too. there is no slot for a micro SD card. Not a problem if you use the cloud to back them up, but I don't always go were I have a data connection, plus I like to move my videos between devices. And the front facing camera feels off. I personally like the centered punch out cameras on the LG and Samsung phones that I have used.Overall. this is a good value. Even with the arrival of 5G network on the horizon. I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand. Has a well matched processor and ram configuration and has 128GB of storage. which should be enough for most users. the front facing camera works really well on video calls even in low light.

       " '  I typically buy a \"flagship\" phone every 3-4 years until the battery craps out. My last HTC10 went through 3 batteries before I finally cracked the screen and had to buy a new phone.

The setup was easy and pulled data from my old phone as well as all the updated versions of the apps from my old phoneBattery life is just crazy. The phone came with about 60% charge. The included fast charger topped it off pretty fast. I wanted to condition the battery by running it way down before recharging a few times. I was kinda shocked that it took almost 3 days to get the phone down to <30% with my typical usage. Adaptive battery is on by default, and I typically have about 3 hours of screen time per day, and it hasn\\'t had me searching for a charger once. This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I\\'m sure it is true for heavy users. But for those that aren\\'t on social media all day, this thing will be running for at least 2 days before you have to charge it. The battery life is just awesome.Also, in the first week my phone took 1 major and 2 minor updates which was nice. All my previous carrier phones would get at most 2 updates over their lives. This one gets them as soon as they are released.',\n",
       " \"  I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you.Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine.Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8.There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places.One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece.As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update.Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE.The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones.The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors.Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc.\",\n",
       " '  With this phone, the hardware and the software are allowed to integrate into their perfect potential. Google being the creator of both is likely what makes this phone better than its (overpriced) competitors. I haven\\'t had the phone for quite a month yet, so I\\'ll update this review if I need to. Here\\'s where a more \"budget\" phone surprisingly stands out:1) The speaker has more clarity versus that of the Note10+.2) The fingerprint reader on the back has a much higher success rate than the Note10+\\'s (in regards to accuracy). It is also easier to physically use.3) Google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked. So if you are feeling bold, you can load on a custom ROM. (Who knows? Maybe that would help you learn to love coding; it did for me.)4) Insane battery life. I charge it every other night. And this isn\\'t with light use; I\\'d say the same might be true for you.5) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold. It rarely falls out of my hand, unlike the Note10+.It really should get a star off for not being water-resistant, and another half-star off for not supporting wireless charging. But it\\'s just such a well-performing machine that I refuse to subtract anything from my rating.TL;DR - This is the closest Android you can get to what makes an iPhone so special, which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory.',\n",

It really is a workhorse that can keep up with the big boys until it's Achilles heel is exposed....build quality.I purchased a Crave protective case when I bought the phone. It was on the phone right after the 4a was unboxed and never removed. On the 5th day of ownership it slipped out of my hand, falling less than 3 feet to the ground (driveway). I picked up the phone, placed my finger on the reader and was shocked to see that the impact had cracked the screen!

Seems comparable in size and feel go my pixel 2. Overall, a Good cheaper iphone alternative.Basic phone Setup took less than 10minutes. I simply took the simcard out his old phone and popped it into the pixel 4a. He uses consumer cellular. He says it works great.

This was a phone for my wife, who had particular requirements for a phone. She doesn't like phones larger than 6 inches, which rapidly reduces the field. Ease of use was important, decent camera, she doesn't use resource heavy apps, mid level storage and important for me I think was the guaranteed Android updates.Not a lot of contenders, but as a OnePlus user myself, I'd say this phone ticks the right boxes at an affordable price. If you're tired of the phablets or want a phone that delivers respectable performance, is free of bloatware and has a decent camera at a reasonable price.....you probably can't go wrong with the Pixel4a.\",\n",
       " \"  I bought this on a whim after using various Galaxy phones since 2013.  Being very adjusted to that version of Android OS that Galaxy uses, it's weird at first to see Google's take on an Android OS but after only about an hour or two, it's pretty convenient in this phone.  My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device, but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined, I had all my music, photos, apps, wallpapers, and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up.  A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it's like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it.  The display is clear and sharp, the touch is consistent, the camera is superb for the price that you pay, and the software is rather simple and clean to use.  If you're concerned about the punch-out camera in the top left of the screen like I was, don't worry.  It's barely noticeable when using the device like normal.  This phone's size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use. The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it's being used.  So far, I really like my Pixel 4a and I'm happy I jumped ship.  If you're someone who wants a phone for more basic tasks while being streamlined, then pick this up and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

The fine print informed me that in a few weeks the free trial would roll over into a paid monthly subscription unless I cancelled before the trial period ended. I have spent days trying to cancel this, there is NO WAY to cancel a You Tube Music trial membership before the rollover.

       " '  Hello Reader,First of all, I would like to clarify one thing, I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only, which is:To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4aSo, If you are looking for any Android phone, please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a.I placed the order on \"Feb 4th 2021\", and I received it on \"Feb 7th 2021\", I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by\"Triplenet Pricing INC\" in USA, That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days.Pros:1- Very good speaker sound, for a small phone.2- good screen resolution and touch.3- good reception for carrier signal.4- Only Google Apps installed by default.5- ironically, Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards, that is why it\\'s supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOSCons:1- I consider it expensive for its HW specs, there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis, for example: OnePlus 7.2- the phone edges have air pockets, you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges, the body is polycarbonate unibody, what do you expect.3- Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector, you will lose it very quickly if you did not. Conclusion:If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand, think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a, you can find a better phone with same or lees price.Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to, and you have your own reasons to do that, as I do.',\n",

Compared to my previous Moto, this thing sips power.It has 6 gig of ram, which means it will stay speedy for a couple years.  There is no external memory... but the 128 gig onboard is plenty.I bought mine unlocked (it will work with pretty much any carrier) and I use it on the Hello Mobile network (they piggyback T-Mobile).  It helps to be a bit of a geek to get set up on Hello Mobile (all online, no stores) but once set up it is the cheapest out there.  I get 4 lines of unlimited everything for 70 bucks a month.\",\n",

What I wasn't expecting, and this is why I returned the phone, was the lack of customization. Here are two examples: the search box on the home screen could not be moved (or removed) and the app screen did not have the capability of creating folders. So if you want to group apps together (like all of the Google apps), you need to create shortcuts and create a folder for them on your home screen. This still leaves the app screen cluttered and disorganized.If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the Pixel, then you will probably like this phone. If you are used to being able to customize your phone, you should look elsewhere until Google provides this basic functionality.\",\n",

Screen scratched very easily. Battery life is pretty unremarkable, I get about a day of use with it. Screen is actually smaller than my last phone. Speakers are also pretty average, didn't impress me at all. My Motorola sounded way better.I had to get a new phone since my carrier didn't want to support VOLTE on that model.

Night mode is absolutely amazing. Takes amazing pictures, sharp and color accurate. Video recording is great as well. The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2-3 second to process it, but other than that it is really really good, like one of the best.Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying, but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use, even during watching videos and movies. I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing, unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner.Battery, the probably the only downside of this phone, you might be like why? well because it is inconsistent, it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours! but on others it might last 3 or 4, I don't understand why is the battery like this, from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time. But overall I would rate it 4 stars, would have been 5 if it was not like this.Fingerprint scanned is, well really really fast, almost instant, but like other fingerprint scanners, if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them, but its like this on like 90% of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn't really bother me.Build quality is good, I don't mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand, its smooth and not slippery, it is really nice to hold it in hand, but as most other users I have a case on it.Other google features really make this phone a good experience, for example the music recognition and others.Overall this phone is a solid 4.7 out of 5, as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great.

The feel on the phone itself is a bit on the slippery side, so just get a rubber case and you'll be fine(everyone uses that anyways). The phone has a lot of automated functions built directly into the phone, so you don't need a ton of third party apps to do basic things. The only core function 3rd party apps that i currently use are:-Soft screenlocking (i'm not a huge fan of button pressing)-fingerprint gesture (so i can lock and unlock with just a finger on the sensor)-document scanner (this should be built directly into camera apps today, but you know...)I like that the home button has been built into a soft one (like i said i'm not a huge fan of button pressing)The swipe keyboard is very quick and gets the right words.The only problem i've encountered in the 7 months of usage is that you have to keep the light sensor cleaned, because the adaptive brightness will occasionaly make the screen unusable in sunlight, then you have to get to a shade to manually turn up the brightness.

Ha.), I can say that their software, and phone hardware, is fantastic.It does eveything quickly, with no hang; although, if you try hard enough you can slow it for a moment. Software is clean and it facilitates its own use more than it hinders it. No flashiness, all subtle polish over the original design. Very nice.A very hardy battery.No flashy outer design, very few visible markings.The BEST part is how clicky the volume and power switches are. It's an actual pleasure to use, everytime.The camera is adequate. Pretty disappointing, actually. I loved the first Pixel for its image quality, and this one is identical. Literally. They did improve the computational processing, but... eh, four years later and I really expected better. The sensor is quite dated. BUT, it does its job, and slightly better than the first iteration, so, I am not too deposed over it.Overall, love this thing. Although, it IS a budget phone. Do consider that.

Learning how to navigate takes a little time. But, it's going well and is easy to learn. Happy with my choice, so far. It's been good enough that my husband also bought one.\",\n",
       " \"  I replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge with this phone.  So far, it's been a great phone. I decided the high-dollar flagship phones just aren't worth the cost for me.  I don't use most of the features. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition.  I simply want a phone that doesn't lag. The camera is great. Battery life is better than I expected. I don't think I'll fill the 128gb of storage. I hold on to my electronics for as long as I can, so if this will last me more than two or three years, then I'll consider whatever Google has at that time.\",\n",
       " \"  Honestly I love this phone. It's quite the step up from the Galaxy j7 I had before. The fingerprint scanner is so good, i've never had issues with it being able to read my fingerprint. The next thing I love about this phone is the camera. The camera is amazing. It's able to zoom in really nicely and even has a night time mode where it is able to capture more light which makes dark pictures much more vibrant. The screen is very scratch resistant as well and even tho the phone is made out of plastic, i havent had any issues with body damage even tho i have dropped it once or twice. But that's probably bcuz I keep it in a case. The only thing that I was a bit disappointed by was the battery life which is not as good as my last phone and runs down quickly when I have the brightness up too high. But I havent had a super big issue with running out of battery life before the end of the day. I think this phone is a really good deal for its price point. totally worth it.\",\n",
       " '  The phone came earlier than expected.  It was easy to set up.  It is a little narrower than my old phone so it is easier to grip.  Took photos and love the quality of them; they are so much sharper than the ones I took with my old phone.  Just for the camera, I think this is an excellent phone for the price!!!',\n",
       " \"  I don't care for 5G so this was the best option for me. You get nearly all the same features as the 4a 5G and the 5, minus a few gimmicky camera tricks for recording videos. I think I'll live. The battery lasts all day with heavy use and the charger is fast. 0-100% in one hour. The google pixel experience is all here and for this price, that's a steal.\",\n",
       " '  Mine replaced a Pixel (1). I loved the fingerprint reader on the back. My wife upgraded hers earlier and got a Pixel 3 which still had the reader on back. Camera is awesome, battery life seems to have doubled but maybe just a new phone and size. I did not need the 5G microwave blasting me. 4G is just fine. Like the new features like swipe to go back...too bad not also swipe forward in browser (I hate that on a phone). Camera nice, but could have been better. Glad they did not have the face crap recognition.',\n",

You hardly have to charge the thing to begin with. The fingerprint reader is awesome to replace passwords on my financial apps that I prefer not to have memorized. The camera is awesome and the night sight is a cool feature. The battery lasts almost 2 days and charges to 100% in 90 minutes. There are a ton of technical reviews on the tech websites so I'll end it here\",\n",

I was a bit worried about transferring all my information from one opening system to the other but, using the provided cable, it was effortless and took just a few minutes.

Minor problem.I picked this phone because of the excellent camera and the good price. I’m very happy with it.',\n",
       " \"  This phone ticks so many boxes for me, from the compact size and stellar battery life. To the rapid charging and super smooth OS. It feels good to be back on a Pixel. I was a tad disappointed with the rear-facing camera. While I knew that it was not a key feature, I did expect a bit more from it, but it is still decent. The font size is also small and doesn't increase to the size I would've expected, similarly, the volume is low-ish. Overall, still a great phone.\",\n",

Literally no complaints.  Ol' Goog's knocked this one out of the park.\",\n",
       " '  I switched from a Samsung Galaxy S8 to the Google Pixel 4a (not 5G).  Overall it is good, but one BIG feature that does not work is the phone ringtone compatibility with a bluetooth-enabled hearing aid.  I wear Phonak Audeo M90-RT hearing aids, and on the S8, the phone would ring in my hearing aid with my desired ringtone, but only vibrate on the phone unless the hearing aid was off.  Then it would both ring and vibrate on the phone itself.On the Pixel 4a, apparently by design, the only available ringtone options are ring, vibrate or silent.  Regardless of the ringtone set, I get some chimes in my hearing aid.  I called Google tech support and was told this is working as designed, even though other notifications work as I want.  They said it is a difference between media settings and ringtones and ringtones could not do what I wanted and that nobody had reported this issue before.  They told me that even though both phones are android, Samsung has made modifications that Google has not.  This is a big deal to me, and while I am happy with the phone overall, I probably would not have purchased it if I had known this.',\n",

I\\'m aware that this is a bargain phone because it\\'s so cheap but to me, this is unacceptable in a smartphone. My iPhone 7 before this lasted for 3 years without a case and dropping it many times from taller heights without any issue. Clearly poorly made. In addition, Google was not helpful and said they would not pay the $130 to fix it. Poor customer service - never had any experience like this with Apple.

Watched YouTube all day and only went to 50% battery. Never had to even use battery saver. I was worried about the smaller size but it's a non issue. Great screen resolution and takes great pictures for a phone. I turned off the finger print recognition because with a case on it's hard to get a good read. I turned off the gesture controls instead using the normal Android three button set up since they don't work well. For 350 bucks it's honestly the best phone you can get.\",\n",

It is fast in loading apps. Reviews say some phones are faster because of processor. If they are then you're talking super fast. I'm not a tech geek so I wouldn't know.

This might be because the adaptive battery feature needs to learn more about my usage.-Auto Rotation is not as good as the iPhone. It takes longer to auto rotate. Sometimes it just doesn\\'t rotate at all.Overall, I can\\'t complain about the phone with such a low price tag. It works well and takes good \"point and shoot\" pictures.',\n",

It holds a charge significantly better than the S6. No reason why you can't go a full day with a full charge even if you're watching videos all day. It also learns your habits and lets you know in advance if you should charge your phone.Another cool feature is it allows you to watch videos on Youtube while using other apps even if you don't have a premium subscription. Very happy with my purchase.\",\n",

It has its own charger style (not Android or iPhone)  so I plan to buy an extra cord for on the go. Battery life is insane and I love the fingerprint on the back.

You have to swipe up from the bottom to check your apps, you also have to swipe up to check recent apps, besides these 2 instances fighting each other, the phone likes to ignore your swipe as well The phone is also very slippery but cases are hard to find. Like most phones, this one bugs right the hell out when exposed to rain.The pros, call screening and night photos are actually great.Overall I do not recommend buying this phone. If you have been disrespected by samsung or apple, try an LG or a 1 plus. Google is not as intuitive with it's own software as you might think.\",\n",

       " '  Luego de probar el teléfono una semana, mis conclusiones más relevantes (y por las cuales recomiendo este teléfono), son las siguientes:- Cámara 9/10. Sólo le falta versatilidad, en calidad visual y detalle de lo MEJOR que hay en el mercado. En video es bueno, pero se podría haber mejorado un poco más (apple sigue siendo superior en esto).- Tamaño 10/10. Muy ergonómico para el día a día, fácilmente se puede ocupar con una sola mano, liviano.- Software 8.5/10. Android de Google va muy fluido en este dispositivo, a pesar de que el chip 730G es inferior a otros (765G). Puntos positivos, los 3 años de actualizaciones, Google assistant y que no tiene app\\'s basura como MIUI y Samsung. Sin embargo android 11 hay que mejorarlo un poco más, lo cuál es entendible ya que se ha actualizado recientemente.- Batería 7/10. Para mi uno de los puntos más \"flojos\". Google hizo una buena optimización con el consumo de la batería y se debe destacar, fácilmente se puede llegar a un día de uso (en cuarentena he ocupado bastante el consumo multimedia, YT, instagram). Sin embargo, no sé cómo se comportará en un año más, razón por la cuál hubiera agradecido tener una batería de al menos 3400 mA o más.- Diseño y Construcción 7/10. Destacar que el teléfono en mano se ve mucho mejor que en fotos, o entrega una sensación un poco más premium de lo que realmente esperaba. El acabado en plástico me da cierta sensación de fragilidad si el teléfono se llegara a caer y temo por la pantalla (espero estar equivocado). Por último, visualmente se debe mejorar, sigue siendo un teléfono poco atractivo para la mayoría de usuarios. Creo que si Google mejorara sus diseños, podrían atraer a muchos más consumidores.-Precio 10/10. A pesar del costo de envío e importación, sigue siendo mejor alternativa que los modelos que se venden en mi país (Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, etc.) por el mismo precio.',\n",

I like plastic body even if it creaks a bit from pressure. The phone is cold, you can make video calls for more than 2-3 hours and play something - your pixel won't heat your hand too much. Stereosound is another cool addition. Battery is perfect for medium/high usage for 1 day. I use my phone with transparent silicon case and tempered glass in front. Screen protector doesn't fill all the space to the corners so I'm still trying to find another glass for full screen coverage. Hope this phone will age well.
